spice (0.12.2-0nocelt1exp) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * debian/patches:
     - Refresh link-libspice-server-with-libm-libpthread.patch
  * Refresh debian/cpyright, new files added
  * Build client, upstream don't build client by default
  * Refresh libspice-server1.symbols
  * Add libglib2.0-dev to Build-Depends

  [ Michael Tokarev ]
  * refresh make-celt-to-be-optional.patch (minor context diff)
  * do not build-depend on libspice-protocol-dev
    (upstream always uses included copy)
  * add (versioned) dependency on libspice-protocol-dev to libspice-server-dev
    package, since when the latter is installed, embedded protocol headers
    are not installed
  * do not build-depend on mesa libs (OpenGL is not enabled by default
    and is not recommended by upstream)
  * do not build-depend on libogg-dev
  * configure with --disable-silent-rules, so that the compiler command
    line is visible (this fixes the lintian warnings about hardening flags)

spice (0.10.1-3~nocelt) experimental; urgency=low

  * Applying for co-maintenance, adding myself to Uploaders (Closes: #671627)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.3 (no changes)
  * link-libspice-server-with-libm-libpthread.patch - missing libraries

  * consolidate clean target in debian/rules
  * 2 patches:
    - fix-error-path-return-in-snd_set_record_peer.patch (from upstream git),
      which is a pre-requisite for the next patch, and

    This makes it possible to build spice without celt.

    which is generated at configure time.
