	pulse: do not abort on corking no stream
	There is no guarantee that a stream actually exist when min-latency
	change is notified.

	Check that there is an actual stream before calling cork().  All callers
	where previously checking that stream existed. Add a pre-condition to
	verify argument and spot that error is from spice-gtk itself.

	Fixes the following crash:
	 #1  0x0000003c12e34105 in abort () at abort.c:92

	channel: swap channel GSocketConnection on migration
	When migration completes, unrefing the new connection leads to original
	GSocket pending refs, and thus the sockets stay in CLOSE_WAIT.

	This is a regression from 8029bd0 where GSocketConnection is kept around
	to satisfy old glib.

	Fix SASL for mechanism using WANT_CLIENT_FIRST
	Current code works with DIGEST-MD5, but not with PLAIN.

	about this:

	main: fix recent main_channel_reset() warning
	Fix wrong warning added in 0704147d.

	(lt-spicy:17511):
	GSpice-WARNING **: (channel-main.c:415):spice_main_channel_reset:
	runtime check failed: (c->agent_connected == FALSE)

	coroutine: make gthread coroutine pass tests
	The coroutine entry() return value must be passed via the caller->data,
	since coroutine_swap() returns from->data. (this is needed because
	coroutine_swap() argument is used both to return from entry() or to send
	data to a running coroutine)

	When leaving a coroutine, clear its caller.

	Return correct coroutine_self() before other coroutine are initialized.

	tests: add some coroutine tests

	coroutine: replace IN_MAIN_CONTEXT macro
	Use a nicer function, with correct prefix.
	Remove extra "context" from function name

	coroutine: error out on OOM or impossible conditions
	Take an approach similar to gthreads, which are considered as low
	level/must work features by glib, which aborts on failures.

	channel: get rid of connection_id, available from session

	channel: remove useless desc != NULL check
	spice_channel_type_to_string() does not return NULL

	main: send max-clipboard to agent
	Send configured max-clipboard size to the agent, after receiving agent
	capabilities.

	See also spice-protocol patch description:
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/spice-devel/2013-November/015254.html

	main: simplify usage of VD_AGENT_HAS_CAPABILITY
	Introduce a helper function test_agent_cap() to clear the code a
	little bit.

	main: use self for main channel variable
	This simplifies the following commit which uses even more
	SPICE_MAIN_CHANNEL macro, and makes the code unnecessarily heavy.

	Add SPICE_MAX_CLIPBOARD environment variable
	Allow to easily override default max-clipboard value with environment
	variable.

	Block sending clipboard data > max-clipboard
	Attempt to send very large clipboard data may easy cause OOM
	abort, either in  gdk - some patch are proposed to improve the situation,
	or in spice-gtk itself.

	Let's have a property that blocks unreasonably big clipboard data from
	being processed (by default 100mb). Users willing to send larger data
	can use the send basic drag-drop send file instead, or tweak the
	property value.

2013-11-19  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Use system-wide trust certificate store
	Currently, spice-gtk will look in $HOME/.spicec/spice_truststore.pem
	by default for its trust certificate store (to verify the certificates
	used during SPICE TLS connections).
	However, these days, progress is under-way to have a system-wide
	certificate store [1].
	In order to use it, we only need to call SSL_CTX_set_default_verify_paths()
	and it will automatically use the shared system CA store if the distro
	is properly setup.
	We only try to use that store if there was no user-provided CA file to use,
	or if we failed to load it.

	[1] https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/SharedSystemCertificates

	build-sys: Add real autodetection of python
	configure help text says that by default python will be used automatically
	if appropriate, however this only means that on !windows and !gtk3, we will
	force build of the python bindings, and fail if any needed package to build
	them is missing.

	This commit improves on the current checks so that when autodetecting
	python, if a package is missing then build of the bindings is silently
	disabled rather than failing.

	build-sys: Re-enable building of python bindings by default
	Commit daa4ece tried to disable building of python bindings on Windows by
	default, but in doing so, it also disabled building of python bindings by
	default when we are building neither for Windows nor for gtk3.

	build-sys: Fix invalid 'test' syntax in configure.ac
	test ... -o test ... is not a valid shell construct, change it to
	test ... || test ... as this is more portable than test ... -o ...

	This was causing a warning when running configure.

	Fix leak of mmapped memory when cc_init() fails

	Check coroutine_init() return value
	coroutine_init() can fail, but spice-channel.c was not checking its return
	value, which could lead to some crashes if coroutine_init() failed and we
	then try to use coroutine_yieldto()

2013-11-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Free coroutine stack when releasing coroutine
	The coroutine_init function mmap's a stack for the
	ucontext coroutine, but nothing ever munmaps it.

	Abort if mmap of coroutine stack fails
	If we fail to mmap the stack, abort the processs rather
	than returning an error. This is standard practice in
	glib apps, and the caller was not checking the
	coroutine_init() return code leading to memory corruption.

2013-11-18  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix IN_MAIN_CONTEXT when using coroutine=gthread
	The IN_MAIN_CONTEXT macro checks coroutine_self()->caller against NULL to
	decide whether we are in the main context or not. However, this is an
	implementation detail of the ucontext coroutine implementation, in the
	gthread implementation, coroutine_self()->caller will be non-NULL even in
	the main context.

	This commit introduces a coroutine_is_main_context() method which each
	coroutine backend implements. It turns out it can be implemented the same
	way for each backend.

	Fix crash on remote-viewer startup with gthread coroutine
	g_object_notify_main_context() was recently changed to automatically
	detect whether we are running in the main context or not, and SpiceSession
	is now using g_object_notify_main_context().

	In order to achieve that, IN_MAIN_CONTEXT is used, but it's not safe
	to be used before coroutine_init() is called. IN_MAIN_CONTEXT expands to
	(coroutine_self()->caller == NULL), but coroutine_self() will be NULL when
	using gthreads for the coroutine implementation until coroutine_init() has
	been called.

	Before coroutine_init() has been called, we'll always be running in the
	main context, so we can just add a check for coroutine_self() != NULL to
	IN_MAIN_CONTEXT to solve that issue.

	coroutine: fix current coroutine
	When leaving a coroutine, it swaps back to where it came from, not to
	the leader/main coroutine.

	coroutine: add some preconditions

2013-11-07  Jonathon Jongsma  <jjongsma@redhat.com>

	Guarantee that 'uuid' property is notified after connection
	This creates a synchronization point and allows API users to rely on the fact
	that they'll always get a UUID notification before all of the channels are
	created.

	Make sure property notifications are done in the main context
	Modify g_object_notify_main_conetxt() to work whether it's called from the main
	context or a coroutine context.  Change object notify calls in SpiceSession to
	use g_object_notify_main_context() instead of g_object_notify().

	Revert "Add ability to get SpiceDisplay resolution"
	This reverts commit a285e0187d15ad650f6524f3811072fa55b20617.

	This API was not actually needed for what I intended to use it for.  So revert
	for now.  We can always add it back if necessary in the future.

	Conflicts:

	display: blank surface on creation
	In theory, zero-ing the surface shouldn't be necessary, as only
	invalidated/painted region should be shown. However, this results in
	less artifacts on resolution changes (probably some regions are painted,
	but with masks, blend, copy etc), in particular on console after VM
	reboot.

	util: do not overwrite G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all

	Export spice_uuid_to_string() properly
	Update map-file and spice-glib-sym-file

	Expose spice_uuid_to_string() as public API
	SpiceSeession has a 'uuid' property that is a byte array, but clients often need
	the uuid in string format (for writing to disk, etc).  Rather than having each
	client re-implement this, expose the utility function as public API in
	spice-gtk.

	channel-cursor: mono cursors edge highlighting
	Fix 998529, mono (invert) cursors not visible on a black background, by doing
	simple edge detection on the cursor (this is done once when the cursor
	is changed and then cached, cursors are 32x32 generally) and thus having
	a cursor with contrast on both dark and light backgrounds.

	When (if) GDK gets invert cursor support (wayland?) then we can just use
	the cursor as is. Until then X doesn't provide any way I see of solving
	this otherwise. The end result was tested with the I beam cursor that
	the original bug was referring to (run putty on a windows 7 vm) and
	looks ok to me.

	Moving the core function to spice-util for testing.

	It turns out that the sasl_callback_t data passed when calling
	sasl_client_new() must be valid until sasl_dispose() is called. I could not
	find mentions of this in the official documentation but
	https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/subversion-dev/201109.mbox/%3C20110908072256.GN25324@ted.stsp.name%3E
	describes what happens.
	Making the sasl_callback_t structure static should be enough to guarantee
	that the data will stay around long enough.

	Display g_debug messages when SPICE_DEBUG is set
	When SPICE_DEBUG is set but --spice-debug is not used, we fail
	to set G_MESSAGES_DEBUG to the log domain used by spice-gtk, which
	causes debug messages not to be printed as one would expect.

	Fix --spice-debug
	If spice_util_set_debug() gets called before spice_util_get_debug(),
	then the value set using spice_util_set_debug() will be overridden
	by the result of g_getenv("SPICE_DEBUG") != NULL the first time
	spice_util_get_debug() is called.

	This causes remote-viewer --spice-debug to not enable debug as
	advertised if SPICE_DEBUG is not set.

	An alternate fix would have been to set debug_once.status to
	G_ONCE_STATUS_READY but then we would lose the thread-safety
	guarantees GOnce gives us.

2013-10-10  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Fix switch to old SPICE protocol
	After the previous commit, spice_channel_switch_protocol() is now
	called when needed, but it's not doing anything. What happens is
	that spice_channel_switch_protocol() triggers a channel disconnection
	and then it queues an idle to reconnect (after having changed the
	protocol version to be used).

	When spice_channel_recv_link_hdr() returns, we need to jump out of
	the coroutine to let the idle trigger and the new channel coroutine
	be started. But jumping out of the coroutine will call channel_disconnect()
	which calls channel_reset() which disables the idle switch_protocol()
	just queued. This causes the connection attempt to be apparently
	stuck with nothing happening.

	Falling back to the older SPICE protocol is not the only situation
	when we need to drop the current connection attempt and reconnect,
	we also need to do that when the remote server returns
	SPICE_LINK_ERR_NEED_SECURED to let the client know it needs to use
	a secure port for this channel. This is handled by the 'switch_tls'
	variable set in spice_channel_recv_link_msg and handled in
	spice_channel_coroutine().

	'switch_tls' does the same thing as spice_channel_switch_protocol(),
	except that it calls spice_channel_connect() after channel_disconnect()
	has been called, which means the idle queued by channel_connect()
	won't get cleared.

	This all that commit does, remove the spice_channel_switch_protocol()
	method and use the same codepath as 'switch_tls' to handle the
	reconnection.

	Reenable call to switch_protocol() on protocol version mismatches
	This partially reverts b19acbc. This commit broke the fallback
	to the old protocol as it added a check for c->peer_msg != NULL
	before calling switch_protocol(), but mismatch between local
	and remote protocol versions is detected before c->peer_msg is
	allocated, so:
	    if (c->peer_msg != NULL && c->link_hdr.major_version != 1) {
	         SPICE_DEBUG("%s: error, switching to protocol 1 (spice 0.4)",
	c->name);
	         spice_channel_switch_protocol(channel, 1);
	         return TRUE;
	    }
	will never get triggered when c->peer_hdr.major_version !=
	c->link_hdr.major_version

	The crash described in b19acbc occurred when calling
	spice_channel_recv_link_msg() in spice_channel_coroutine()
	after a call to spice_channel_recv_link_hdr() failed and did
	not set c->peer_msg.

	This commit removes the c>peer_msg check done before calling
	spice_channel_switch_protocol() so that it gets called when needed,
	but makes sure that we return FALSE to indicate that an error happened
	and that we need to reconnect. This way we won't try to call
	spice_channel_recv_link_msg() when c->peer_msg is NULL.

	Use latest warnings.m4 from gnulib
	The one we were using does not work properly with clang, causing
	the build process to try to use -f/-W options that are not
	supported by clang.

	gtk: simplify spice_channel_recv_msg
	Use of coroutines allow to simplify spice_channel_recv_msg(), it doesn't
	need to keep current reading state, it can rely on the coroutine stack
	for that.

	gtk: use slices for frequently allocated objects

	gtk: use GHashTable in display_cache
	The cache code isn't very quick, it shows up in profilers.  Using
	GHashTable allows to simplify the code while making it faster.

	channel: do not reenter the mainloop at every iteration
	The current coroutine channel_iterate() creates a GSource for the socket
	reenters the mainloop waiting for IO condition. This is really heavy
	usage of mainloop showing up in system time and user space
	profiling (10% of CPU time spent in mainloop overhead). Instead flush
	all pending input messages before switching context and reentering main
	loop.

	This is the kind of results I get with a replay:

	channels: use spice_channel_set_handlers()
	This allows to simplify a little bit derived class (no need to override

	filtering messages, as in the following patch)

	channel: add spice_channel_set_handlers()
	This function will allow to set base handlers and specific channel

	base channel virtual handle_msg().

	display: use bitfields for surface flags
	Checking by value make the flag fields useless. Unfortunately, when

	gtk: handle clipboard CRLF conversion
	gtk+ internal text/utf8 is using LF conversion, on all platforms.
	Even though the toolkit may only handle a single line ending type, we
	may want to avoid the conversion for Spice use cases, gtk+ could learn a
	new native utf8 target type, see also:
	https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=706657

	In the meantime, the only thing we need to convert, is to/from crlf
	guest (from/to lf). This is what this change is about.

	It has been tested successfully with the various guest/client OS
	combinations.

2013-08-23  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Revert "channel-main: Convert text line-endings if necessary (rhbz#752350)"
	This implementation assumes that the toolkit doesn't do any conversion
	on its own. This is actually not the case, gtk+ converts line endings
	already on windows.  It would be pretty ugly to do conversions back and
	forth at different levels. So the channel implementation shouldn't
	try to do conversion, and implementation must be done at higher level,
	where the actual system clipboard implementation is known (at
	gtk-session for instance)

	Since this code hasn't been officially released, let's revert it and
	implement a better crlf conversion handling in gtk-session in the
	following commits.

	This reverts commit e45a446a9981ad4adaeff9c885962a8c6140333e.

	gtk: remove dead code

2013-08-20  Uri Lublin  <uril@redhat.com>

	Starting libusbx version 1.0.13 (commit 8cd30bb7066f785ee78cf6c3dccafdbc4b957b50)
	windows device enumeration changed and root hubs address number is 1 intead
	of 0xff.

	This patch uses LIBUSBX_API_VERSION which was introduced after 1.0.13 release
	(commit 9d368fc4774344d81ab02840f3a8478301bfb6fa).

	win usb: request for driver uninstall only for driver that were installed
	Currently when spice_usb_device_manager_remove_dev() is called,
	for windows clients a request to uninstall the driver is sent to usbclerk.

	This cause problems when 2 instances (A and B) of the client are running:
	- Both A and B get notified about a new USB device when it's plugged in
	- A is requested to usbredir the USB device.
	- A requests usbclerk to install WinUSB driver for that device.
	- usbclerk starts installing the driver
	- Windows sends to both A and B - device removal events, which may cause
	  B to call spice_usb_device_manager_remove_dev.
	- usbclerk completes installing the driver and reply to A
	- B requests usbclerk to remove the WinUSB driver for that device.

	To prevent that, spice-gtk now requests usbclerk to remove the driver
	only if it was the instance that requested the driver to be installed.
	This is done with the help of a new device SPICE_USB_DEVICE_STATE_INSTALLED
	state.

	When initializing a software smartcard, vcard_emul_init() can

	win32: don't block key up events
	The win32 ll keyboard hook avoid Windows and other application to
	receive global keyboard events. But some key combinations can't be
	filtered, such as Win+L. However, the windows lock screen doesn't catch
	that the Win key is released, when virt-viewer still holds the hook and
	filters it.

	So pressing Win+L quickly will lock the screen, but some key press in
	the password entry will still be handled as if the Win key was pressed,
	such as Win+P or Win+U and probably other, and prevents user from typing
	his password.

	The only working solution I could find is to just let go all the release
	key events in the hook. There doesn't seem any drawback with that.

	mingw: Fix non-working AltGr with some layouts
	Running virt-viewer-x64-0.5.6.msi, on Windows 7, connecting to QEMU using
	spice, AltGR key combinations fails (using Swedish keyboard layout both at
	server and client).

	I suspect that this is a variant of
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=904092.

	After some debugging, I realized that there is an extra VK_LCONTROL
	keypress sent by Windows. This extra VK_LCONTROL will then make the key
	e.g. AltGr-< actually be Control-AltGr-<, which is not interpreted as a |
	sign.

	So in spice-widget.c : keyboard_hook_cb(), I added SPICE_DEBUG lines which
	printed out the hooked->scanCode, and realized that this extra VK_LCONTROL
	has a very suspect scanCode with bit 9 set. If I instead press the left
	Ctrl key, it will also emit VK_LCONTROL, but with bit 9 cleared.

	So I just made sure that keyboard_hook_cb(), silently dropped these strange
	VK_LCONTROL events, which seems to work for me.

	channel-display: protect video streaming from temporarily unsynced mm_time (migration related)
	rhbz#951664

	When the src and dst servers have different mm-times, we can
	hit a case when for a short period of time the session mm-time and
	the video mm-time are not synced. If the video mm-time is much
	bigger than the session mm-time, the next stream rendering will be
	scheduled to (video-mm-time - session-mm-time), and even after
	the different mm-times are synced, the video won't be rendered
	till the rendering timeout that was scheduled based on a wrong mm-time,
	takes place.
	This patch protects from such cases. You can find more details in the
	code comments.

	spice-session: new signal for notifying on a significant change in mm-time
	mm-time can change after migration. This can cause video synchronization
	problems after migration if not handled appropriately (see rhbz#951664).

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=924577

	main: do not send monitors config if some are missing
	Spice-gtk does a bit of client-side work by optionnally delaying sending
	the monitor configuration to the guest automatically. However, the
	client may be slow to set all the monitors, so teach the timer to not
	fire the event unless at least the number of monitors set explicitely
	enabled or disabled matches the number of display channels.

	This avoid some configuration races when connecting to a multi-channel

	channel-display: trigger re-sync of audio playback latency when there are frequent video frame drops
	This was added in order to respond more quickly when the audio and video playback are
	not synchronized, and when the latency between the client and the server
	is high (i.e., when the server response to the status is delayed).

	playback: support syncing the playback latency via session

	spice-pulse: adjust the playback latency when the min-latency property changes
	If the current latency is smaller than the new min-latency
	value, we cork the playback till the target latency is achieved.

	Note: I didn't modify the prebuf configuration and used
	pa_stream_prebuf, because pulse updated the prebuf only if
	I set both prebuf and tlength to be target_latency*2. Then,
	due to the tlength growth, each time the playback latency deviated
	from the target latency, an underflow occurred. Since the latency
	that is computed by the server is not exact and is based on its
	current evaluation of the bit-rate, which is dynamic, it is better not
	to change the tlength (in order to avoid unnecessary underflows).

	channel-playback: support SPICE_MSG_PLAYBACK_LATENCY
	Add a new property for minimum playback latency. This property is
	updated with the value from SPICE_MSG_PLAYBACK_LATENCY.

	channel-main: Don't g_warn when not finding a file-xfer-id
	Since the agent channel can have a significant latency, it is possible
	for a cancel send from the client to the agent and a status message from
	the agent to cross each other. If this happens then the file-xfer will no
	longer be on the list.

	Printing a g_warning on this (rare but triggerable) condition will only get
	us hard to debug bug reports, so turn it into a SPICE_DEBUG.

	channel-main: Cancel active file-xfers on channel/agent disconnect

	channel-main: Check no callbacks are pending on xfer start and end
	We should never have pending callbacks when we receive a file-xfer start or
	end (success) message from the agent.

	channel-main: Don't call g_input_stream_close on a NULL stream
	If we fail to open a file, task->file_stream will be NULL, so we should
	not call g_input_stream_close on it.

	channel-main: Allow calling file_xfer_close_cb with a NULL object
	So that it can used for cleanup before we've a file_stream.

	Note this also gets rid of the weird double initialization of the local
	stream variable.

	channel-main: Don't close the file_stream if callbacks are pending
	If file_xfer_completed gets called while callbacks are pending we should
	not call g_input_stream_close_async, because:
	1) Doing so while another operation is pending on the file_stream will fail
	2) Doing so while a non file_stream callback is pending may result in the
	task being freed before the callback runs, resulting in a use after free.

	This patch fixes this by setting a pending flag when any callbacks are
	scheduled, and clearing it when it runs + checking for task->error
	from all callbacks and if that is set call file_xfer_completed again.

	channel-main: Use file_xfer_completed where appropriate

	channel-main: file_xfer_failed -> file_xfer_completed
	Make file_xfer_failed usable for all file_stream closing.

	channel-main: Make SpiceFileXferTask-s ref the channel
	So that the channel sticks around while their callbacks are completing.

	channel-main: Reset agent message receive state on agent stop
	Discard any partially received messages from the agent on agent stop.

	channel-main: Add a spice_main_channel_reset_agent helper function

	channel-main: Drop bogus xfer_id check from file_xfer_send_start_msg_async
	xfer_id > UINT32_MAX is never true since xfer_id is an uint32_t, and
	thus explicit wrapping is not necessary since it will wrap every
	UINT32_MAX + 1 itereations anyways.

	channel-main: Properly verify result in spice_main_file_copy_finish
	Call g_simple_async_result_is_valid on the passed in result to verify it is
	what we expect.

	channel-main: Call g_simple_async_result_is_valid first
	Call g_simple_async_result_is_valid before using the result.

	Revert "channel-main: Fix dangling references to freed file-xfer-tasks on agent cancel"
	The fix from commit 19313a133af0d2404b29914b5937219127ad455b is incomplete,
	this commit added code to file_xfer_close_cb, to remove any reference to
	the task being closed from the flushing queue.

	But file_xfer_flushed / file_xfer_flush_async execute file_xfer_data_flushed_cb
	from an idle handler, so it is possible that when file_xfer_close_cb runs and
	frees the task, it is not part of the flushing queue, but a
	file_xfer_data_flushed_cb with the task as user_data argument still needs to
	run, and when it will run it will refer to the now freed task.

	A related problem which is also addressed in this patchset happens when we
	receive a file-xfer-cancel from the agent when an async operation on the
	file_stream is pending, since we then cannot call g_input_stream_close_async
	on it. This is fixed in the patchset by adding a pending flag to the task
	struct, and the problem with pending flushes is solved in the same way.

	usb-device-manager: fix log messages to match vid:pid change
	On Windows clients now USB devices are identified by their vid:pid
	(sometimes these values are being held by variables "bus" and "addr")
	Change log messages accordingly.

	usb-device-manager: Windows: identify devices by vid:pid instead of bus.address
	rhbz#842816

	Sometimes bus.address of a USB device changes upon WinUSB driver installation
	for that device. This makes bus.address not a good identifier to use when
	running on Windows machines.

	Instead this patch makes usb-device-manager, when running on a Windows client,
	identify devices by their vid:pid.

	What changes were made in this patch (in addition to previous patches):
	- vid:pid are asked from the udev.
	- match functions that compare vid:pid were added
	- when comparing devices vid:pid are used.

	This also means that a scenario where two USB devices with the same vid:pid
	on a Windows client is not supported. However there was a problem with this
	scenario before as on Windows drivers for (specific) USB devices are
	installed based on their vid:pid.

	usb-device-manager: Windows: spice_usb_device_equal_libdev: compare vid:pid
	When comparing spice_usb_device with a libusb_device on Windows clients,
	use vid:pid instead of bus.address

	It seems that a device bus.address may change when WinUSB driver
	is being installed.

	usb-device-manager: use a function to get vid:pid from a libusb_device
	To be reused later.

	Also implemented a get_device_descriptor function (in case it will be
	needed in the future).

	usb-device-manager: find_libdev: use a match function
	Instead of comparing directly against <bus, address>.

	In preparation of comparing against vid:pid for Windows clients.

	usb-device-manager: find_device: use a match function
	Instead of comparing directly against <bus, address>

	In preparation of comparing against vid:pid for Windows clients.

	usb-device-manager: constify spice_usb_device_get_ functions

	win-usb-dev: compare vid:pid instead of bus.addr (Windows)
	It seems that sometimes, on Win7 clients, bus.addr is changing
	when WinUSB driver is being installed (e.g. 4.1 -> 4.2).

	So compare vid:pid instead.

	Release pointer grab on grab-broken
	On windows, the client receives a WM_KILLFOCUS event which generates
	solely a keyboard grab-broken event.

	This event is received when pressing ctrl-alt-del (to show up the task
	manager), and we need to release the pointer grab and clip region in
	this case for the client to be usable.

	This also clear the clipping region when the client pops-up a dialog.

	Since keyboard focus is a pre-requisite for pointer grab, it sounds
	logical to release the pointer grab if losing keyboard focus, but for
	now, we just release it in grab-broken, as a result of discussion on
	the ML.

	    GSocketConnection: don't close the socket if it's still reffed

	    When disposing a GSocketConnection, don't explicitly close the
	    underlying GSocket. The GSocket will close itself if it gets
	    destroyed, and if it doesn't get destroyed, that presumably means the
	    app still wants to use it. Eg, this lets you use GSocketClient to
	    create a GSocketConnection, and then take the GSocket and destroy the
	    GSocketConnection.

	    https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=616855

	and spice-gtk commit 0f9a432c "session: allow to connect via HTTP CONNECT
	proxy" changed spice_session_channel_open_host to get its socket by doing:

	open_host->socket = g_socket_connection_get_socket(connection);
	g_object_ref(open_host->socket);
	g_object_unref(connection);
	(see socket_client_connect_ready)

	If glib does not have the commit mentioned above, then this won't
	work as expected as open_host->socket will get closed when 'connection'
	gets destroyed.

	This commit changes spice_session_channel_open_host to return a
	GSocketConnection rather than a GSocket so that we can keep the
	socket open even on older glib versions.

	Huge thanks go to Brad Campbell <brad@fnarfbargle.com> for doing all the

	spice-widget: Reconfiguring the grab is only needed on win32
	Commit 8a7e72e3 "widget: regrab when widget is reconfigured" adds an
	ungrab + grab call to the configure event handling code. Because:
	"On Windows, we need to update the cursor clip. Call ungrab&grab to update it."

	But on X11 this is not needed, see man XGrabPointer, which explains that
	the grab automatically adjusts to window resizing.

	Not only is it not needed it is also racy, causing spice-gtk based
	apps to log messages like:
	(remote-viewer:9935): GSpice-WARNING **: pointer grab failed 3

	This patch fixes this by disabling the ungrab + re-grab on non-win32.

	spice-widget: Fix auto-grab on window size change
	Commit 8a7e72e3 "widget: regrab when widget is reconfigured" adds an
	ungrab + grab call to the configure event handling code. But it does this
	without checking if the mouse is grabbed at all, causing an unsolicited
	grab in certain scenarios, ie:

	1) User boots a vm
	2) Connects with remote-viewer
	3) Goes and do some web-browsing while the vm boots
	4) Mouse happens to hover over the remote-viewer window
	5) Guests changes resolution (ie X starts)
	6) The mouse is grabbed, and when the user tries to move it to
	   click something in his web-browser this does not work.

	This patch fixes this by checking that the mouse is grabbed before doing
	the ungrab + re-grab which is needed to reconfigure the grab to the new window
	size / location.

	spice-widget: Ignore duplicate configure events
	gtk seems to be sending us identical / repeated configure events quite
	regularly (atleast under X11), we don't care about re-configures with the
	same size + coordinates, so filter these out.

	Note this patch uses the SpiceDisplayPrivate mx and my members which
	were already defined to store the window position, but not yet used.

2013-02-06  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	widget: Fix mouse position reporting for multiple monitors on 1 display channel
	VDAgentMouseState contains a display_id and expects coordinates in multi-mon
	mode to be relative to the origin of the monitor specified by the display_id.

	The agent will then adjust the mouse coordinates for the position of the
	monitor as configured in the guest.

	In multiple monitors on 1 display channel spice-gtk is wrongly setting
	display_id to the channel_id (which is 0 for all monitors), and is working
	around the problems this causes by doing the adjustment of the mouse position
	itself.

	But the agent is still applying the correction for the monitor position to
	all VDAgentMouseState messages it gets, and since for all monitors a display_id
	of 0 is reported it always uses the position of display 0 for the correction.

	Since the position of display 0 is usally +0+0 this usually works, but as soon
	as the position of display 0 is not +0+0, the correction will get done twice
	for display 0, and the display 0 position will wrongly get added the mouse
	position for other displays.

	This patch fixes this by properly setting display_id, and removing the
	modification of the mouse coordinates as that is already done in the agent.

	channel-main: Fix monitors_align to not shuffle monitor order
	Before this patch monitor_align was calling qsort directly on the
	VDAgentMonConfig monitors array, but VDAgentMonConfig does not contain
	an id, so the order matters!

	This fixes (for example) 2 issues with having 3 windows/monitors on a row
	numbered 1-3, ordered left-to-right as 1-2-3, and then changing the
	ordering to 1-3-2:
	1) Window 3 would be resized to the size of window 2, and window 2 would
	   get resized to the size of window 3.
	2) Dragging a window on monitor 1 over its right edge, makes the part over
	   the edge show up on the right monitor, rather then on the middle.
	This is happening because the agent is configuring qxl-1 (which is monitor 2)
	with the monitors[1] data, which after the qsort contains the size and
	coordinates of monitor 3.

	Note this only happens with virt-viewer fixed to properly send window
	coordinates, as before that all monitors had x and y set to 0 making the
	sort a nop.

	channel-main: Add support for VD_AGENT_CAP_SPARSE_MONITORS_CONFIG (rhbz#881072)

	spice-widget: update_monitor_area: Fix memory-leak on whole fallback
	When we've successfully gotten the monitors display-channel property, but
	still end up falling back to whole-display mode, we still need to free
	the monitors array.

	spice-widget: Search monitor info by display monitor-id
	As discussed indexing the display-channel's monitors property by monitor-id
	causes problems with the vdagent's new sparse monitor config support.

	Searching the monitors property by monitor-id avoids these problems.

	file-xfer: handle "drag-data-received" signal
	When user drags a file to SpiceDisplay and drops it, a signal named
	"drag-data-received" will be emitted, the signal will be received by
	SpiceDisplay, then our signal handler should receive data which contains
	file path, and call spice_main_file_copy_async() to transfer file to guest.

	file-xfer: disable file-xfer when agent is not connected

	file-xfer: handling various transfer messages in main channel
	This patch is aimed to handle various file xfer messages.

	How it works:
	0) our main channel introduces a API spice_main_file_copy_async().

	1) When user drags a file and drop to spice client, spice client will
	   catch a signal "drag-data-received", then it should call
	   spice_main_file_copy_async() for transfering file to guest.

	2) In main channel: when spice_main_file_copy_async() get called with file
	   list passed, the API will send a start message which includes file
	   and other needed information for each file. Then it will create a
	   new xfer task and insert task list for each file, and return to caller.

	3) According to the response message sent from guest, our main channel
	   decides whether send more data, or cancel this xfer task.

	4) When file transfer has finished, file xfer task will be removed from
	   task list.

2013-01-09  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	Send monitor config to the agent on spice_main_set_display_enabled (#881072)
	Currently we send an updated monitor-config to the agent whenever some
	of the display settings are changed (whenever spice_main_set_display is
	called), including when a new display is enabled, as that involves
	creating a new window, which calls spice_main_set_display. The only
	exception to this is when a display gets disabled.

	This is rather inconistent, it causes the user to be able to move windows
	in the guest to the now no longer visible monitor, and any windows which
	were already there are hidden... until something else triggers us sending
	updated monitor info. Withe gnome3 an alt-tab away and back again from a still
	open display-window is enough to trigger the update, and then the guest will
	all of a sudden become aware of the monitor no longer being there and
	re-arrange windows accordingly, on an alt-tab in the client machine ...
	not pretty.

	So lets make things consistent and also send the agent updated monitor info
	from spice_main_set_display_enabled, like we already do from
	spice_main_set_display.

	Fix switching to TLS regression
	The commit fcbbc248a8f885f9a9a6e7c47d7aae0c1ab3cd1b changed the way a

	coroutine main cleanup (finishing in main coroutine) while switching
	to TLS is recycling the channel. That part of the code is a bit
	difficult to grasp, but with this refactoring, I think it makes it
	easier to understand the reconnection.

	Clean-up idle handler when leaving the open_host_idle()

	acl-helper policykit policy: Allow redir by default for console users
	This makes usb-redir a lot more userfriendly to use. This  has been
	discussed with the security team and they are ok with it, rationale:

	Since we only set <allow_active> to yes, we only give raw usb access
	to users *physically present behind the machine*. This is ok since
	they already have full control over usb devices anyways, they can
	always just unplug the device and put it in a user controlled machine.

	This follows how we already grant a great deal of access to users
	*physically present behind the machine* including dangerous things like
	/dev/sg access for cd/dvd writers. And raw usb access to all devices which
	happen to have a userspace driver rather then an in kernel driver.

	Also the opening up is limited compared to the existing opening up of
	other devices listed above in that:

	1) It will only happen on machines which have spice-glib installed
	2) We are not opening up the device nodes rights automatically, as an udev rule
	would do. So there is no chance that any random app can start (accidentally)
	poking the devices.

	session: allow to connect via HTTP CONNECT proxy
	Allow to connect to a Spice server via a HTTP proxy with CONNECT
	method. spice-gtk will use the SPICE_PROXY environment variable, which
	can currently only have the following syntax: [http://]hostname[:port]

	This is paving the way to more proxies support (socks4/socks5).

	This code is now entirely sync (it was not even completely async), the
	following patch will make it all async again.

	Tested with Squid, locally only.

	Add SpiceProxy object
	Add a simple object to handle the SPICE_PROXY values.

	It's not clear to me whether each GIO user needs to handle the proxy
	configuration, or if there is a more global mechanism (via
	g_network_address_parse_uri())

	Also, the parsing is currently very limited and only support basic

	channel: rely on couroutine instead of channel state
	We can simplify the channel state callback and simplify a little
	the code by relying on coroutine state instead.

	spicy: demo SpicePort usage
	spicy has been modified to recognized 2 different port types to play
	with:

	* org.spice.spicy: will connect the port to the current stdin/stdout,
	  and can be used as a chardev for the qemu monitor

	* org.spice.spicy.break: will send a break event on connect and
	  disconnect immediately (exercice the port event and flush)

	Add a port channel
	A Spice port channel carry arbitrary data between the Spice client and
	the Spice server. It may be used to provide additional services on top
	of a Spice connection. For example, a channel can be associated with
	the qemu monitor for the client to interact with it, just like any
	qemu chardev. Or it may be used with various protocols, such as the
	Spice Controller.

	A port kind is identified simply by a fqdn, such as org.qemu.monitor,
	org.spice.spicy.test or org.ovirt.controller...

	win32: translate virtual-key code to scancode via MapVirtualKey
	Local client keyboard layout shouldn't affect hardware scancode sent
	to guest, so that guest keyboard layout configuration can map it
	properly.

	Unfortunately, the Win32 GdkEventKey.hardware_keycode isn't a hardware
	scancode, but the Windows virtual-key code. We could modify Gdk to
	return the scancode (available in MSG.lParam or via global hook), but
	that would mean some Gdk breakage, or some unnecessary complexity.
	Instead, we can rely on MapVirtualKey(), which translates the
	vitual-key code into a scan code using current keyboard layout.

	This solves the following bug:

	win32: track current window handle

	win32: clip and move cursor within window region
	Windows grab do not exist like on X11, so we need to clip the cursor
	to our client window, while making sure it doesn't overlap with
	windows statusbar. When wrapping the cursor, we need to make sure we
	also stay within the clip region, or else the clip is inverted
	(pointer can't enter the clip region anymore), and we also lose the
	keyboard hook/grab.

	The end result works better than spicec, which didn't exclude the
	Windows statusbar, and was subject to losing pointer when wrapping
	mouse over it.

	Another approach I have been playing with is to clip the cursor, and
	process raw input messages, this will have the advantage to work even
	when the client is completely out of the working area (under the
	statusbar for example), but the complexity involved is too high for
	very poor benefit (interacting with a non-visible client), we could
	even argue that the behaviour implemented by this patch is more
	correct (it refuses to grab the cursor if the client isn't visible in
	the working area).

	v2:
	- choose the nearest monitor for clipping
	- the ClipRegion is in Windows coordinate, we can't use gdk warp
	- fix https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=872640

	channel-inputs: Fix sending 00 scancodes to guests with scancode cap
	The code for handling single key up / down events in spice-server is:
	        SpiceMsgcKeyDown *key_down = (SpiceMsgcKeyDown *)buf;
	        uint8_t *now = (uint8_t *)&key_down->code;
	        uint8_t *end = now + sizeof(key_down->code);
	        for (; now < end && *now; now++) {
	            kbd_push_scan(keyboard, *now);
	        }

	Notice the *now, which makes sure that no scancodes with the value 0 get
	send! But the new SPICE_MSGC_INPUTS_KEY_SCANCODE in the server does:

	        uint8_t *code = (uint8_t *)buf;
	        for (i = 0; i < size; i++) {
	            kbd_push_scan(keyboard, code[i]);
	        }

	And thus will push any 0 bytes in the buffer. Resulting in these message
	in the guest:

	atkbd serio0: Unknown key pressed (translated set 2, code 0x0 on isa0060/serio0).
	atkbd serio0: Use 'setkeycodes 00 <keycode>' to make it known.

	Rather then making the server skip 0 bytes I believe it is better to just
	make spice-gtk not send these in the first place, which is what this patch
	does.

	Deal with libusbredirparser.pc rename to libusbredirparser-0.5.pc
	The usbredir 0.5 release introduced the new API for 64 bit packet ids, but
	it kept the libusbredirparser.pc name as is, meaning that older versions of
	qemu will still have their pkg-config check for usbredirparser fulfilled,
	and build with the usb-redir device. Due to the API change there will be
	some compiler warnings, but the build will succeed, however the usb-redir
	device will be broken on 32 bit machines.

	To solve this, the usbredir-0.5.2 release renames the libusbredirparser.pc
	file to libusbredirparser-0.5.pc, so that it will no longer fulfill the
	pkg-config check of the qemu-1.2 and older releases, stopping the (silent)
	breakage.

	spice-gtk does not use the changed parts of the API, but does
	use libusbredirparser for the usbredirfilter* functions. This patch adapts
	spice-gtk's configure to accept both the libusbredirparser-0.5 and the
	libusbredirparser pkg-config names.

	If the host is enclosed in [], it's intentionally not escaped as this

	widget: differentiate key press & release from press only events
	Until now, Spice clients only sent separate key events for press and
	release. But this may result in unwanted key repetition from guest VM
	side. It seems OSes have various implementations. While MS Windows
	relies on hardware key repeats (which are several sequential press
	events), otoh, X11 uses software key repeat (although not Linux
	keyboard/VT by default).

	We can't easily disable guest side repeaters, as it may be enforced by
	other components (a X11 client can adjust each key individually, or
	the desktop settings may change it etc.). Neither can we rely only on
	guest software repeater as Windows doesn't seem to have one by
	default, so we need to keep sending multiple press events as of today.

	It seems a nice way to improve the situation is to send a single
	"press&release" key event when the user released the key within a
	short delay. If the key is pressed for longer, we keep the existing
	behaviour which has been working pretty well so far, sending separate
	"press", then repeatedly "press", and an ending "release" event.

	v2:
	- fix some commit message spelling spotted by Alon & Christophe
	- simplify a bit the timer handling code after Hans review
	- remove the submodule change (will be updated in earler patch once
	  pushed upstream)

	widget: add keypress-delay property
	The delay before the press event is sent to the server if the key is
	kept pressed. If the key is released within that time, that delay is
	ignored and a single key-press-release event will be sent.

	widget: give more context to send_key()
	- use a more explicit SendKeyType enum
	- if the key is a modifier key, we don't want to delay press event

	v2: fix compilation (remove down usage)

	inputs: add spice_inputs_key_press_and_release()
	If the server is capable of SPICE_INPUTS_CAP_SCANCODE, then we send

	channel-smartcard: do not attach temporary migration channel to smartcard
	During migration, the smartcard channel that belongs to the temporary
	copied session shouldn't be active.

	migration: copy enable-smartcard/audio/usbredir state to the migrated session
	Otherwise, we will not create smartcard/usb channel on the destination
	side, and we will create audio channels, no matter if they existed
	of didn't exist for the src side.

	seamless migration: don't reset messages data when swapping channels
	When swapping the src and dest channels's, we need to keep
	the xmit_queue and msg serials. Their state is expected to stay the same
	after migration.

	seamless migration: transfer pending msgs to the destination, instead of sending them to the src before FLUSH_MARK
	In order to save migration time, and probably also decrease migration
	data size, we push the flush mark to the src server before any other
	message. All the other pending msgs will be sent later to the
	destination server (see next patch).

	seamless migration: src and dest servers handshake
	Flow:
	(1) *src* main channel coroutine (main_handle_migrate_begin_seamless):
	    handles SPICE_MSG_MAIN_MIGRATE_BEGIN_SEAMLESS; yields to the main loop,
	    supplying it the destination information needed for connection.
	(2) main context (migrate_connect):
	    Establishes a new session for connecting to the destination.
	    After all the channels are opened (async), their state, except for
	    the one of the main channel, is modified to
	    SPICE_CHANNEL_STATE_MIGRATING (see migrate_channel_event_cb);
	    no reading is done from the channel during this state.
	    The dest main channel's state is changed to SPICE_CHANNEL_STATE_MIGRATION_HANDSHAKE

	(3) *dest* main channel coroutine: sends to the dest server SPICE_MSGC_MAIN_MIGRATE_DST_DO_SEAMLESS
	    (see spice_channel_recv_auth)
	(4) *dest* main channel coroutine: recevices SPICE_MSG_MAIN_MIGRATE_DST_SEAMLESS_ACK/NACK.
	     adds main_migrate_handshake_done to the main loop.
	(5) main context: when all the dest session channels are connected, and the main channel handshake
	    is done, we yield to the src main channel coroutine (see
	    migrate_channel_event_cb and main_migrate_handshake_done)
	(6) *src* main channel coroutine: sends to the src server
	    SPICE_MSGC_MAIN_MIGRATE_(CONNECTED|CONNECTED_SEAMLESS|CONNECT_ERROR)

2012-08-08  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	build: make spice-controller.pc installation conditional
	It shouldn't be installed when controller support is disabled.

	build: generate sym-file
	When -Wl,--version-script is not available, we fallback to using
	libtool --export-symbols feature, but the needed sym-file is missing
	from git. This commit adds generation of the sym-file to the
	update-map-file Makefile target, and adds a sym-file to git.
	The linker on OSX Lion doesn't like to have non-existing symbols
	specified in the symbol files it's given, so the symbols need to
	be split in glib symbols and gtk symbols.

2012-08-07  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	build: add --enable-smartcard=auto support
	Currently, when running configure with no arguments, smartcard
	support is enabled by default, and configure will fail if it cannot
	find libcacard. This commit adds a --enable-smartcard=auto mode to
	configure which will use automatically enable smartcard support if
	libcacard is available, but it will be silently disabled if libcacard
	is not available. Passing --enable-smartcard will fail if libcacard
	is not available. Passing --disable-smartcard will always disable
	smartcard support and will not test for libcacard availability.

	build: make controller build optional
	Apart from the Vala bindings, this is the only part of spice-gtk
	which requires Vala to be built from git. Since it's only useful
	when spice-gtk is used in conjunction with an oVirt browser plugin,
	letting people disabling it will not necessarily cause issues.

2012-08-05  Matthias Clasen  <mclasen@redhat.com>

	Don't use GDK_THREADS_ENTER/LEAVE
	These macros have been deprecated. The quick fix for now is to just use the
	functions gdk_threads_enter/leave instead. They are deprecated as well, but
	deprecated functions don't cause the build to fail (unless you use -Werror).

2012-07-30  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	Remove "usbredirhost: " prefix from usbredirhost error messages
	libusbredirhost prefixes all its messages with "usbredirhhost: ", which
	is useful when logging to stderr, but not so much when showing the error
	to the user in an error dialog, so remove the "usbredirhost: " prefix
	when we store the message in a GError.

	channel-display: Set monitors_max to 1 on init
	This fixes remote-viewer with the new multi monitor support not working
	when connecting to a spice-server without the new multi-monitor support.

	Before this fix remote-viewer would hit the following g_return_if_fail:
	(remote-viewer:24787): remote-viewer-CRITICAL **:
	 virt_viewer_session_spice_display_monitors:
	  assertion `monitors->len <= monitors_max' failed

	spice-widget: release mouse grab on keyboard-grab-inhibit
	The purpose of the keyboard-grab-inihbit mechanism is to allow other apps
	to grab the input while the spice-widget has the focus, mainly when we're
	going to invoke policykit for usb-redirection, as that the policy-kit
	agent may want to grab the input.

	Before this patch we were only inhibitting the keyboard grab, which works fine
	for vms which are in client mouse mode, but is not enough for vms which are
	in server mouse mode.

	This patch also releases the mouse grab on keyboard-grab-inhibit, fixing
	the policykit dialog not showing (and thus usb redir not working) when
	running with server mouse mode. Note that this makes the inhibit-keyboard-grab
	name of the property no longer really cover what it does, but allas it is
	part of our ABI...

2012-07-18  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Run-time check monitor per display count <= 256
	Limit range of monitors, to avoid potential crashes lead by invalid
	received MonitorConfig values (could be misconfigured or misbehaving
	guest)

	This is a a client-side implementation limitation. Eventually, the
	range could be inscreased (or unlimited == 0) in the future...

2012-07-16  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Enable the display early when the widget is created
	The  spice_main_set_display_enabled() function  is  used  to mark  the
	display/monitor  config  as  enabled.  In  order  to  simplify  client
	implementation, the widget enables  the matching display automatically
	when the channel mark is received. This is only for legacy reason, and
	my lack  of understanding at  that time. It  could as well  be enabled
	earlier, when the widget is created.  It wasn't really a good decision
	to disable monitor when the mark is off, which can be toggled when the
	primary surface is resize for example, and can cause some races..

	Add SpiceDisplay:ready property
	There are several condition to meet in order to have a widget ready to
	be displayed: the monitor must exist, the area must intersect, and the
	display mark must be reached. This  property will help clients to know
	when the  widget display is  ready. Until now,  it was relying  on the
	channel  mark signal  only,  and had  to  deal with  the  rest of  the
	conditions without much help.

	Handle MonitorsConfig::max_allowed

	main: send monitor config immediately
	The only way this can be called currently is via the main/system
	coroutine. Remove display timer if any.

	Implement simple monitors alignment

	widget: use display monitors configuration
	Use display::monitors property to manage display area. Call
	update_area_monitor() to update the widget area depending on monitor
	configuration

	spicy: disable display when deleting window

	spicy: learn to deal with monitors

	Make-up a MonitorConfig if the server doesn't provide one
	This allows easier compatibility for clients that don't have to
	check and interact differently depending on channel capabilities.

	Handle SPICE_MSG_DISPLAY_MONITORS_CONFIG

	Don't attempt to draw an invalid area
	If we don't intersect, the area is invalid or of size 0.

	Use monitor_id to compute display_id

	Document spice_main_send_monitor_config()

	widget: don't forget to disconnect all signals handlers
	We forgot about display-mark. Use spice_g_signal_connect_object()
	helper, which will disconnect properly in all circunstances.

	spice_channel_connect() success if state >= CONNECTING
	We may have several widget trying to re-connect the channels now.
	It is fine to return successfully if we are already connecting or
	connected.

	widget: add monitor property with ctor

	Claim SPICE_DISPLAY_CAP_MONITORS_CONFIG

	Add spice_display_get_primary()

	display: add readonly monitors property

	glib-compat: add g_clear_pointer
	A helpful macro from glib 2.34

	Change surface_id to a guint32
	That's the correct type used by the protocol.

	widget: add main channel before other channels
	Make sure that the d->main channel member can be referenced when
	adding further channels, when we perform their setup.

	Add missing agent cap description

	display: learn to restrict display to an area
	Each spice widget can now restrict the area of the primary
	surface they show and interact with by setting the private
	area member.

	A nice clean-up would be to seperate an area object that
	would deal with clipping, input translation and color
	conversion, but the resulting code would be similar anyway

	widget: simplify redraw call

	of the machine before being redirected, then let the user know that

	Introduce SpiceUsbDeviceInfo to be kept instead of a libusb_device
	For Windows, it's better not to keep references for libusb_devices

	controller: async flush read/write
	Windows namedpipes behave a bit differently from Unix socket, and may
	return incomplete read/write. By using 2 read/write() helpers, try to
	complete the operation before returning. Since the IO operation may be
	splitted over several call, we make sure the buffer pointer is on the
	heap. We use exception for EOF or BROKEN_PIPE condition, which also
	simplifies the code.

	spice-widget: Don't change usbredir/automount settings while redirecting
	The keyboard focus may change while usb-device-manager is in the process of
	redirecting a usb-device (as this may show a policykit dialog). Making
	autoredir/automount setting changes while this is happening is not a good idea!

	Since usb-device-manager already sets keyboard_grab_inhibit when it is
	redirecting to allow the policykit dialog to show, we can use that to
	inhibit usb-autoredir setting changes.

	spice-gtk-session: hookup automount inhibiting
	Inhibit automounting when usb-autoredirection is active.

	Add a desktop-integration helper class
	We need to integrate closely with the desktop environment of the user in
	several cases. Some examples are disabling auto-mounting when auto-usbredir
	is active (rhbz#812972), and disabling the screensaver when fullscreen
	(fdo#34793).

	Unfortuntely these kinds of things require desktop environment specific
	handling. Therefor this patch introduces a desktop-integration helper class,
	which is to server as a container for all sort of desktop environment specific
	functions.

	For now it just supports disabling automounting under Gnome, but this will be
	extended in the future.

	This patch changes the "do we have focus?" tracking, to keeping a counter with
	how many widgets have focus. The reason for this is that sometimes multiple
	spice-widgets can have focus at the same time, yes really! Sometimes (rarely,
	hard to reproduce) the focus in event for one window arrives before the
	focus out of the other window.

	spice-gtk-session: Only update usb "auto-connect" when doing "auto-usb-redir"
	Only update the UsbDeviceManager's "auto-connect" property when
	"auto-usb-redir" is set, otherwise leave it as is. This allows apps to
	control UsbDeviceManager's "auto-connect" directly, without it getting reset
	on every keyboard focus change.

	spice_channel_coroutine: fix function exit in error path
	spice_channel_coroutine returns a void *, but one of its error path
	is doing 'return FALSE'. This commit replaces this return with a
	'goto cleanup' since this is what is done in the other error paths.

	spice_channel_coroutine: emit signals in all error cases
	There are several very unlikely failures where no signal is emitted
	to indicate the failure. Since applications rely on these signals
	to detect spice-gtk connection failures, it's important to emit
	one in all error cases.

	message. The only hint that something went wrong is:
	(remote-viewer:12924): GSpice-WARNING **: loading ca certs from a/home/teuf/foo.crt

	This patch makes sure we emit a SPICE_CHANNEL_ERROR_TLS before

	Clipboard clean-up and fixes for Windows client
	The Windows client was getting in the way of guest copy-paste,
	because when the guest was taking the clipboard grab, the agent
	notifies the client, it takes the grab too, and in return
	receives clipboard notification of new ownership from the client
	clipboard.

	Though we had a hack to check if this new client clipboard event
	is caused by us, the Windows Gtk clipboard is giving 2 notifications
	for some reasons.

	It turned out there is a much better way than the "selfgrab" hack,
	by setting ownership of the clipboard. Problem solved, and cleaner
	code!

	Reset grab-sequence on match
	This avoids triggering the grab event on consecutive
	matches, such as ctrl+alt (match) then ctrl+alt+foo
	(match again) that would prevent the longer combination
	from being sent.

	If grab sequence is matched, still send modifier keys
	If the last key pressed from the grab sequence is a modifier
	key, let send it to the guest too.

	This solves the issue of default grab-sequence being ctrl+alt
	and preventing ctrl+alt+del from working.

	Running out of reserved space, break ABI
	The change abc56811de978ad336a651924a21b920cfe677f0 actually added
	a field in a public struct while changing overall struct size, the
	fields were also reorder, all of this breaks ABI.

	However, we are running out of free space in SpiceChannelClass
	struct. And since the SPICE_RESERVED_PADDING was 44 bytes, that is
	quite limited on 64bits (only 5 pointers fit).

	I propose we break ABI during this cycle. This means that programs
	using spice-gtk will need to be recompiled to use the new library.
	(the old library should be parallel installable though). This let us:
	- use a better SPICE_RESERVED_PADDING based on pointer size, since
	  it is what is usually added for virtual methods
	- reset the amount taken from the padding in the various struct
	- reorder fields a little
	- add some missing "priv" pointers
	- whatever I am missing that we can still change before next release

	Please comment if I am missing something, or correct me

	Fix not setting channel specific capabilities upon channel reset
	Related: rhbz#821795

	The capabilities have been zeroed after channel reset, which have lead to

	channels are secured (first attempt to connect the channel with "port"
	has failed; the channel got reset, and then reconnected with "tls-port"

	widget: fix invalid memory ref after channel is distroyed
	When the display channel is destroyed, we disconnect all signals
	handlers, but we don't remove the reference on the primary surface
	data, and that can lead to crashes in a later expose event, reusing
	the canvas surface (ex, if scaling is disabled). Call
	primary_destroy() when disconnecting the channel from the widget.

	We now keep the primary surface during channel reset (right after
	disconnect for example), so the primary surface can be eventually
	recycled, and the widget still holds a valid reference until the
	signal is received. The primary surface is ultimately destroyed during
	finalize, or if the new primary surface size doesn't match.

	controllers: signal when a client is connected

	controller: handle SEND_CAD message as a property

	Fix cursor not being shown in client mode in some cases
	The following seems to happen:
	- cursor-hide (for all cursor/display channels)
	- cursor-set (for all cursor/display channels)

	All cursor/display channels receive cursor-set events when the cursor
	is changed, however, only current display cursor should be drawn in
	server-mode. How to know which display?

	So it will wait until cursor-move to draw it in server-mode on the
	right display.

	In the case of client-mode cursor, it doesn't matter since it will
	depend on which client display the pointer is, so it can be changed
	immediately.

	Do not grab display widget
	We used to gtk_grab_add() after mouse grab to limit the mouse events
	to the display. But it isn't necessary if the display has its own
	window, since gdk_pointer_grab() will be limited to it.

	Note the widget has the keyboard focus & is focused, so this doesn't
	affect keyboard events.

	However, this allows application to keep global accelerators
	functionning if they want to (like virt-viewer with custom key
	bindings).

	Fix non-semi-seamless migration in spicy
	The windows are destroyed during non-semi-seamless migrations, but the
	gtk session and connected handlers remains. When a property changes
	again on it, it will signal a destroyed window and lead to a crash.

	The signal handler should be disconnected when the window is
	destroyed. Since we have N numbers of handlers, it's easier to use
	spice_signal_connect_object() helper to handle this for us by turning
	spice_window structure into a basic GObject.

	That GObject code could be improved, but that wasn't the goal of this
	patch.

	Use given color depth in monitor configuration
	The main channel only relied on

	buildsys: Disable some warnings
	Mostly so that they don't turn into errors when building from source:
	-Wno-missing-field-initializers:
	Because this has to be close to the most stupid warning gcc has ever produced
	-Wno-deprecated-declarations
	Because we use some deprecated functions to avoid #ifdef hell while maintaining
	compat with older gtk / glib versions

	usbredir: Check for existing usb channels after libusb init
	Currently trying to view a usbredir enabled vm from virt-manager causes
	virt-manager to crash. This crash is caused by the following happening:

	-virt-manager sets up the session, including connecting all the channels
	-a spice-gtk internal code path calls spice_usb_device_manager_get()
	-spice_usb_device_manager_get calls channel_new on all already connected
	 usb channels
	-channel_new does:
	 spice_usbredir_channel_set_context(SPICE_USBREDIR_CHANNEL(channel),
	                                    self->priv->context);
	-But self->priv->context has not been set yet (so is NULL) -> segfault!

	This patch fixes this by moving the iterating over already connected
	usb channels to after the setting of self->priv->context. Note this means
	that the channels will no longer get checked when there is no USB_REDIR
	support. That is not a problem since spice_usb_device_manager_initable_init
	will return FALSE in that case anyways.

	Use of 'hh' in the UUID format string is not required. Furthermore
	it causes errors on Mingw32, where the 'hh' modifier is not supported

	Import GNULIB's GCC warning macros
	GNULIB has a helpful module 'manywarnings' which makes it easy
	to turn on every single GCC warning. The general goal is that
	every possible GCC warning should be enabled, except for certain
	blacklisted warnings.

	This imports the GNULIB m4 macros, and updates configure.ac to
	use this new capability. As & when new GCC warnings are created,
	the 'manywarnings.m4' can be refreshed from upstream GNULIB

	* m4/manywarnings.m4, m4/warnings.m4: GNULIB warning macros
	* configure.ac: Remove custom compiler warning checks
	* m4/spice-compile-warnings.m4: Decide what GCC warnings to enable

	Avoid 'goto' jumping over variable initialization
	When a goto statement jumps over a variable declaration with an
	initializer, the state of that variable is undefined. Move the
	declaration further up, so that the goto doesn't jump over it.
	This lets the compiler then warn, if the goto jump results in
	use of undefined values.

	Fix no-arg functions declared () to use (void)
	* common/quic.h, common/rop3.h, common/sw_canvas.h: s/()/(void)/

	Add missing includes & make some functions static
	A number of functions were used without prior declaration. In
	some cases this was due to missing include files. In other cases
	the functions should have just been static.

	Ideally this would allow -Wmissing-declarations to be enabled, but
	the files generated by spice_codegen.py will still trip up on this.

	Ensure all no-args methods are declared (void) not ()
	* common/quic.c, common/rop3.c, common/sw_canvas.c,
	  gtk/spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper.c: s/()/(void)/

	Add printf format annotations to all '...' functions
	To allow the compile to detect incorrect printf formats, any

	* common/canvas_base.c, common/lz.h, common/macros.h: Annotate

	Replace duplicated header declarations
	The usb-helper-acl.h header file duplicated some declarations
	already present in usb-device-manager.h

	The channel-display.c file declared the object init function
	which is already done by the GObject helper macros

	* gtk/channel-display.c: Remove duplicate decl of init function
	* gtk/usb-acl-helper.h: Remove duplicate decls

	Remove arithmetic on void* pointers
	Arithmetic on void * pointers is undefined by the C standard.
	Convert the one case of this to use guint8 instead.

	* gtk/channel-main.c: s/void */guint8 */

	Fix some integer range checks which always evaluate false
	There are some integer range checks which always evaluate false
	due to use of unsigned integer types. One of these would prevent
	detection of encoding errors from celt. The others are simply
	no-ops.

	* gtk/channel-record.c: Make 'frame_size' signed to allow detection
	  of celt encoding errors
	* gtk/spicy.c: nkeys is an unsigned type, so checks for nkeys < 0 are bogus
	* common/pixman_utils.c: SpiceROP is an enum & thus unsigned

	Avoid warnings about empty conditional statement bodies
	Add extra {} braces around if/else statements which only
	call SPICE_DEBUG to avoid:

	../common/ssl_verify.c: In function 'verify_pubkey':
	../common/ssl_verify.c:87:50: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an 'else' statement [-Wempty-body]
	../common/ssl_verify.c: In function 'verify_hostname':
	../common/ssl_verify.c:254:53: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an 'if' statement [-Wempty-body]
	../common/ssl_verify.c: In function 'verify_subject':
	../common/ssl_verify.c:381:41: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an 'else' statement [-Wempty-body]

	Fix deprecation warning handling
	Various methods are deprecated by using the G_GNUC_DEPRECATED_FOR
	macro. Unfortunately this macro was placed in the .c file impl,
	instead of the .h file decl. Thus applications building against
	SPICE-GTK would never see the deprecation warnings. At the same
	time, building SPICE-GTK itself would trigger some of the warnings
	preventing use of -Wdeprecated-declarations to detect use of
	deprecated GTK functions.

	The fix is in multiple parts

	 * Replace calls to G_GNUC_DEPRECATED_FOR with SPICE_DEPRECATED_FOR
	 * Move macros from .c to .h files
	 * Turn SPICE_DEPRECATED_FOR into a no-op if SPICE_NO_DEPRECATED
	   is defined
	 * Define SPICE_NO_DEPRECATED when building

	Fix old style declaration where 'inline' came after return type
	Fix a case of 'static int inline' to be 'static inline int'

	Fix const-correctness of functions & add explicit casts
	Some functions should be declared to take const char * instead
	of plain char *. In other places we intentionally cast away
	const-ness, so we should add explicit casts to stop compiler
	warnings

	Remove non-existant include directories from CFLAGS

	Don't delete gtk-doc.make in distclean
	gtk-doc.make is created by autogen.sh, therefore it should
	not be deleted in distclean, only maintainerclean

	sasl: sasl authentication failure results in disconnection
	When SASL auth failure happen, the Spice server disconnects the

	error out an authentication error.

	sasl: lower visibility of normal debug message
	Those two g_critical() can happen when collecting credentials for the

	build: move @SPICE_GLIB_REQUIRES@ to Requires.private
	The libraries listed in Requires aren't needed during build time, they

	buildsys: Don't link glib-compat.o into libspice-client-gtk.so
	glib-compat.c was added to SPICE_GTK_SOURCES_COMMON since with the
	new SpiceUsbDeviceWidget libspice-client-gtk now also uses G_TYPE_ERROR
	and when compiling with an older glib this gets defined in glib-compat.o

	However doing this turns out to be a very BAD idea, since having
	glib-compat.o linked into 2 different libraries, each defining there
	own private spice_error_get_type, leads to the "GError" type getting
	registered twice with glib, which it does not like.

	So instead of linking glib-compat into 2 different libraries, put it only
	in libspice-client-glib and export spice_error_get_type from
	libspice-client-glib (this is ofcourse intended for libspice-client-gtk
	private use only).

	Use an openssl BIO stream using GSocket
	Until now, the BIO object used by openssl to read & write was using
	the socket fd directly. But the mainloop integration is done with
	GSocket.

	On Windows, the read/write events are cleared after
	g_socket_send()/receive() with private function
	_win32_unset_event_mask. If the glib functions aren't cleared, glib
	source will keep notifying of data available in or out. On Windows,
	this causes a busy loop when doing SSL_read() for example (glib
	POLL_IN data condition is reached and SSL_read() return needs data).

	Instead, openssl should read/write using GSocket methods.

	Link with usbredirparser
	spice-gtk uses usbredirfilter_string_to_rules which is defined
	in usbredirparser but does not link with it. This causes link errors
	on some distributions. Fixes fdo bug #45761.

	widget: allow defining a zoom-level
	Add a "zoom-level" property. Maintain the given scaling ratio when
	scaling is enabled.

	If scaling is disabled, this property is ignored.

	For example at 50%, this allows to fit a 640x480 desktop in a 320x240
	widget and when resizing it to 640x512 to have a 1280x1024 desktop.

	(this feature is required by virt-viewer)

	widget: factor out update_size_request() and scaling_updated()
	Factor out and simplify a little the code to allow easier addition of
	zoom-level property.

	The "set_display" parameter for recalc_geometry() seems to be useless,
	since the code was apparently trying to set the guest to the given
	d->width and d->height, but reseting it to the current value, which
	cancel the effect.

	We should fix the problem of setting the guest resolution at
	display-init time in a follow-up patch since it probably never worked
	with spice-gtk.

2012-01-31  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Report the scaling is 1.0 if the widget isn't realized yet
	To avoid a few warnings in some corner cases.

	Do not grab/release the clipboard on guest without clipboard support
	Add an agent capability check before calling those functions from
	gtk-session. Avoid extra warnings.

	spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper: Fix mention of Lesser in license header

	spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper: ensure we set the acl on a chardev
	Josh Bressers has been so kind to review the usb-acl-helper for possible
	security issues. One of his recomendations was to ensure that the file
	we're setting the acl on is a chardev.

	spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper: Fix memleak
	Not really important given the short livedness of the process, but
	still should be fixed.

	configure: Add an option for building the acl helper as PIE
	Josh Bressers has been so kind to review the usb-acl-helper for possible
	security issues. One of his recomendations was to harden the usb-acl-helper
	by building it as a Position Independent Executable.

	configure.ac: s/x"$have_foo"/"x$have_foo"/
	configure.ac was using 2 slightly different styles for have_foo tests:
	if test x"$have_foo" = "xyes"; then
	and:
	if test "x$have_foo" = "xyes"; then

	Switch to the latter style everywhere for consistency.

	configure.ac: Cleanup policykit checks
	* No need to set AM_CONDITIONAL WITH_POLKIT from the enable_usbredir tests, it
	  get sets from the enable_polkit tests in all paths
	* Improve the help text: mention auto as option, policykit -> PolicyKit,
	  not yes but auto is the default
	* Warn when building with usbredir support but not building the acl helper

2012-01-24  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@redhat.com>

	Add check for Perl::Text::CSV
	This check is only added to configure.ac contrary to the pyparsing
	patch.

	Add check for pyparsing
	Check both in configure.ac (after checking if we need to rebuild
	the marshalling files) and in the python script using pyparsing
	(for people modifying .proto files in tarballs)

	Use PKG_CHECK_EXISTS for g-i has_symbol_prefix check
	GOBJECT_INTROSPECTION_CHECK will alread test for the presence of
	gobject-introspection. The PKG_CHECK_MODULES(GOBJECT_INTROSPECTION)
	call only needs to set the has_symbol_prefix variable, so we can
	use PKG_CHECK_EXISTS here, and let GOBJECT_INTROSPECTION_CHECK do
	the rest of the work.

	Autodetect usbredir and PolicyKit by default
	Currently, usb redirection and policykit are enabled by default,
	and configure will error out if the required dependencies cannot
	be found. This commit changes the default behaviour, by default
	usb redirection/policykit support is automatically enabled/disabled
	depending on the availability of the needed dependencies. Passing
	--enable-usbredir will error out if the dependencies for usb
	redirection cannot be found, ditto for policykit. This should make
	things nicer for people running configure or autogen.sh with no
	argument.

	gtk-session: weak reference the session for clipboard cb
	It seems Gtk is lacking a way to cancel a gtk_clipboard_request_*().

	Although it seems like gtk_selection_remove_all() would solve that
	problem, it will have nasty effect of destroying other pending
	requests from others..

	Let's make use of an extra weak reference object that will be nulled
	when the session is destroyed.

	build: allow out-of-tree building of python bindings

2012-01-17  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	spice-channel: Allow calling spice_msg_out_send from any context
	spice_msg_out can be not only called from system context and usb event
	handling thread context, but also from co-routine context. Calling from
	co-routine context happens when a response gets send synchronously from
	the handle_msg handler for a certain received packet. This happens with
	certain usbredir commands.

	This triggers the following assert in the coroutine code:
	"GSpice-CRITICAL **: g_coroutine_wakeup: assertion `coroutine !=
	 g_coroutine_self()' failed"

	This patch fixes this by making spice_msg_out_send callable from any
	context and at the same time changing the code to not do unnecessary
	wakeups.

2012-01-15  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	usbredir: Add support for filtering out devices from auto-redirection
	Note this patch adds a default filter filtering out HID devices, since
	redirecting ie a mouse plugged into a laptop is usually not what the user
	wants. Also sometimes usb keyboards/mice may experience a glitch causing
	them to temporarily drop of the bus. If this happens when the spice-client
	has focussed it used to redirect them to the vm when they re-appeared,
	not good!

	Fix compilation on mingw/windows

	Warn if windows keyboard hook failed

	Don't release images after the tail gap
	This fix a hang on an image lookup that has already been remved.  It
	only happens in multihead, when stressing a bit the displays.

	The decoder assumed that the last added images is the tail of the
	window. However, there are "gaps" in the window that will be filled by
	other channels. Instead of taking the last added image as the current
	up to date tail, let's take the reference to the last image before the
	first gap as the up to date tail, and release from there.

	The spicec code does things differently, perhaps it needs slightly
	less memory at the cost of added complexity by maintaining list of
	missing images and much more conditions/synchronization.

	Grab focus before grabing keyboard
	Make sure the display has the focus before grabing the keyboard for

	Makefile: Ensure the acl helper is installed before making it suid root
	On my system when running make install, after installing the libraries it
	first executes install-binPROGRAMS:

	  /bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c spicy snappy spicy-st
	libtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c .libs/spicy /usr/bin/spicy
	libtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c .libs/snappy /usr/bin/snappy
	libtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c .libs/spicy-stats /usr/bin/spicy-stats

	Then the install-exec-hook:

	make  install-exec-hook
	make[6]: Entering directory `/home/hans/projects/spice/spice-gtk/gtk'
	chown root /usr/bin//spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper
	chmod u+s  /usr/bin//spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper

	And only then does it install the actual helper by executing
	install-aclPROGRAMS:

	  /bin/sh ../libtool   --mode=install /usr/bin/install -c spice-client-glib-usb
	libtool: install: /usr/bin/install -c spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper /usr/bin

	Which means that the install-exec-hook runs too early, either there is no
	spice-client-glib-usb-acl-helper for it to make suid root, or if there is it
	will later get overwritten and its rights will get reset.

	The problem is that install-fooPROGRAMS gets run as part of install-data,
	not install-exec. So we can fix this by changing the code to make the helper
	suid root run from install-data-hook.

	usbredir: Don't directly use g_mutex_foo()
	In glib <= 2.30 g_mutex_foo() are macro's so dereferencing them directly
	does not work.

2012-01-03  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	usbredir: Don't call spice_usbredir_channel_disconnect on channel reset
	channel_reset gets called from spice_channel_disconnect, and
	spice_usbredir_channel_disconnect calls spice_channel_disconnect
	(so as to disconnect the channel when a usb device gets disconnected).

	So calling spice_usbredir_channel_disconnect from channel_reset leads to
	undesirable recursion. More over calling spice_usbredir_channel_disconnect
	disconnects / closes both the channel and *the usb device* and closing the
	usb device on migration is not what we want.

	Note that currently migration of usbredir channels does not work, and this
	patch does not fix this, but it does fix a regression when disconnecting
	usb devices normally (by unplugging them for example).

	usbredir: Give devices a user friendly description
	Before this patch devices were described like this to the user:
	USB device at 2-14
	After this patch the description is:
	SanDisk Cruzer Blade [0781:5567] at 2-14

	usbredir: Drop our embeddied GUsb copy
	No that we no longer use GUsbSource we're hardly using any code from GUsb,
	so drop our embeddied GUsb copy and do the last few things (device
	enumeration through gudev) ourselves.

	usbredir: Remove spice_usb_device_manager_get main_context argument
	Now that we no longer use a GUsbSource this is no longer needed.

	Note this is a change to our public API, but that is ok since we have not
	yet done an official release with usbredir support.

	usbredir: Handle usb events from a thread
	This solves various latency issues with USB handling.

	usbredir: Add locking callbacks for libusbredirhost
	This is a preparation patch for handling usb packet completion in a
	separate thread.

2011-12-22  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	usbredir: Create USB event source on demand
	This is a preparation patch for handling usb packet completion in a
	separate thread.

	usbredir: Use new libusbredirhost write flush callback
	The new (in usbredir-0.3.2) usbredirhost_open_full()
	function allows us to be notified whenever usb packets completing
	result in data to be send to the host. This removes the need for using
	g_usb_source_set_callback and seeing if there is data to write on
	any of the usb channels each time some usb event happens.

	This also bumps the minimum needed libusbredirhost version to 0.3.2

	usbredir: USB channels can not be read only
	A usbredir channel must always be bi-directional. spice-server
	allows only one client to connect even when in multi-client mode. Since
	usually there are multiple usb channels available, it is allowed for one client
	to use one channel, while another client uses another usb channel.

	usbredir: Stop setting private data explictly to NULL on init
	This is not necessary and as we get more private data it becomes
	unyieldly.

	spice-channel: Allow spice_msg_out_send to be called from multiple threads
	This is a preparation patch for handling usb packet completion in a
	separate thread.

	spice-channel: setsockopt TCP_NODELAY
	spicec does this for all channels, and it seems like a good idea to do the
	same in spice-gtk.

	build: depends on spice-protocol 0.9.1

	Support semi-seamless migration
	Yonit Halperin described the flow, that I followed:

	(1) when client_migrate_info is called SPICE_MSG_MAIN_MIGRATE_BEGIN is
	sent to the client.

	Then, the client should link to the target server (SpiceLinkMess),
	i.e., connect all the channels, but it shouldn't poll from the target,
	only from the source. You can refer to RedClient::Migrate class.  The
	connection id in the link message should be the id of the connection
	to the source server.

	(2) The client sends to the source server
	SPICE_MSGC_MAIN_MIGRATE_(CONNECTED|CONNECT_ERROR)

	(3) When migration completes  SPICE_MSG_MAIN_MIGRATE_(END|CANCEL) is
	sent to the client.

	(3.1) In case of SPICE_MSG_MAIN_MIGRATE_CANCEL, the client closes the
	connections to the target.

	(3.2) In case of SPICE_MSG_MAIN_MIGRATE_END, the client should reset
	all the data that is related to the connection to the source and
	complete the transition to the target server (without sending
	ATTACH_CHANNELS, and without guest display initialization via agent).

	Then, the client sends SPICE_MSG_MAIN_MIGRATE_END to the target.

	main: Handle semi-seamless MIGRATION_BEGIN

	spice-channel: cleanup, remove spice_channel_send_msg()
	There are only 2 callers, both of which want it to do a different thing,
	making the callers do this directly allows us to remove
	spice_channel_send_msg(); and gets rid of the weirdness where we've a
	function which can be called in both co-routine and system context.

	spice-channel: Move read only check to spice_channel_write_msg()
	This is a preparation patch for removing spice_channel_send_msg().

	Note that this means that buffered writes won't get checked until they are
	actually send by the co-routine.

	spice-channel: Move setting of header->size to spice_channel_write_msg()
	Just a small cleanup patch.

	spice-channel: replace the xmit buf by a queue of SpiceOutMsg-s
	This has a number of advantages:
	-It significantly simplifies the code
	-It avoids memcpy-ing all the write data one more time
	-It avoids malloc / realloc / free of the xmit buffer
	 (this gets replaced by gslice alloc / free for the queue elements)

	Make sure spice_channel_iterate_write() always flushes *all* pending writes
	This patch changes 1 line, and fixes 2 bugs in this one line:
	1) We keep the xmit_buffer around for reuse (re-filling) later, so checking
	   if we've a xmit_buffer to determine wether we should do a write is wrong,
	   instead we should check if the xmit_buffer has data in it.
	2) If the write blocks, and we switch to another co-routine context, this
	   context may queue more writes, we check for this and throw away the
	   buffer we've been consuming when this happens, since the other context
	   will then have allocated a new buffer. But when this happens, we do *not*
	   consume the new buffer. So the queued data will not get transmitted
	   until the co-routine gets woken up by either another write, or by
	   receiving data to read.
	   This patch fixes this by changing the if to a while.

	Note that the code in question gets completely removed by the next patch in
	this series. As I noticed this while rewriting the code in question, still
	I decided to do a separate patch to fix this to:
	1) Document this issue in the old code
	2) Otherwise the move from the if to the while will happen in the new code
	   which may confuse readers of that patch.

	spice_msg_out[_send_internal]: Take ownership of the passed SpiceMsgOut
	All callers of spice_msg_out[_send_internal] unref the message immediately
	after calling spice_msg_out[_send_internal]. This patch changes the
	semantics so that spice_msg_out[_send_internal] takes ownership and it
	is responsible for unref-ing the passed in SpiceMsgOut.

	This is a preparation patch for changing the buffered write code
	to use a queue of SpiceMsgOut-s, rather then memcpy the message contents
	into an intermediate buffer.

	channel-smartcard: unref in flight messages as soon as they are sent
	This is a preparation patch for making spice_msg_out_send() take ownership
	of the passed in msg.

	Disable mouse accelleration when grabbing the mouse (in server mode)
	Otherwise accel will be applied twice, once by the client and then once

	spice-widget: rename mouse_update to update_mouse_mode.
	We already have update_mouse_pointer and update_mouse_grab, so having
	a mouse_update function without specifying what "part" of the mouse handling
	it exactly updates is confusing, rename it to update_mouse_mode to reflect
	what it does and to match the other names.

	spice-widget: cleanup mouse handling.
	Some background on this patch, we currently behave
	as follows in server mouse mode:

	1) When spicy first connects, a frozen guest cursor is shown
	 (no mouse events are send to the guest) and the client cursor
	 is set to the standard right pointer,

	2) When one clicks on / inside the spice-widget, the mouse is
	 grabbed, the client cursor is hidden and the guest pointer
	 becomes alive (gets events).

	3) On ungrab we move back to state 1)

	Which is fine, but the code implementing it is somewhat convoluted.
	We have update_mouse_pointer(), which does more then just update the mouse
	pointer, it also calls try_mouse_grab(), and we've update_mouse_grab(),
	which calls update_mouse_pointer() rather then try_mouse_grab().

	* I. lets look at what we currently have in update_mouse_pointer(): *

	    case SPICE_MOUSE_MODE_SERVER:
	        if (!d->mouse_grab_active) {
	            if (gdk_window_get_cursor(window) != NULL)
	                gdk_window_set_cursor(window, NULL);
	        } else {
	            try_mouse_grab(display);
	        }
	        break;

	Now lets invert the test to make it more readable:

	    case SPICE_MOUSE_MODE_SERVER:
	        if (d->mouse_grab_active) {
	            try_mouse_grab(display);
	        } else {
	            if (gdk_window_get_cursor(window) != NULL)
	                gdk_window_set_cursor(window, NULL);
	        }
	        break;

	Hmm, so if we're grabbing the mouse, we try to grab the mouse
	-> does not make sense, esp not since try_mouse_grab() has:

	    if (d->mouse_grab_active)
	        return;

	So we can drop the else block.

	But why the if? Well that would be because when we're grabbing
	the windows should have a blank cursor. But where does that get set?

	The blank cursor gets set in do_pointer_grab(), by specifying a blank
	cursor as the cursor to show as long as the grab is active.

	Since that cursor will be active as long as we're grabbing, so we can
	drop the if (!d->mouse_grab_active) check as well.

	And with the mouse_grab_active check gone, we no longer need to call
	update_mouse_pointer() from try_mouse_ungrab().

	* II. lets look at update_mouse_grab() *

	So currently when the mouse should be grabbed according to the
	mouse-grab and disable-inputs properties, update_mouse_grab() calls
	update_mouse_pointer(), which as discussed above does nothing with the grab,
	as the code path calling try_mouse_grab() is dead code. The right thing to do
	would of course be to have update_mouse_grab() call try_mouse_grab() in this
	case.

	But, that would mean that as soon as the property is changed the cursor will
	get torn away from whereever it is and get grabbed, which may not always
	be desirable. To fix this this patch also moves the mouse_have_pointer
	and keyboard_have_focus checks from mouse_update() to try_mouse_grab()

	usb-device-manager: Don't g_warning on autoconnect failure
	We already emit a signal for this, either the app using spice-client-glib
	listens to this signals and does something with it, or it is not interested
	in this happening, at which point logging a g_warning for it is not really
	useful.

	spicy: Don't show an error dialog on a cancelled device open
	If for example the user plugs in a new device, then gets the policykit agent
	authentication dialog and then unplugs the device, spice-gtk will cancel
	the acl-helper request, which in turn will dismiss the policykit agent
	authentication dialog. Which is all a nice and smooth user experience,
	except that when this happens spicy throws a dialog with an error
	that the open was cancelled. Since a cancel usually is done deliberately
	(such as on the user unpluging the device) no error dialog should be thrown
	for it.

	channel-usbredir: Call the acl helper without first trying to open the device
	Normally opening the USB device without first calling the helper will fail,
	except when the process using spice-gtk is running as root.

	So the current code which first tries to open the USB device before calling
	the helper is optimizing for an exception rather then for the default code
	path. More over it also causes libusb to print the following errors to stderr:
	libusb:error [op_open] libusb couldn't open USB device /dev/bus/usb/002/017: Permission denied.
	libusb:error [op_open] libusb requires write access to USB device nodes.

	So this patch changes things to first call the helper and only then try
	to open the device node.

	This patch also modifies the helper to not call policykit when called by
	a root process, since the set_facl which it will do, if policykit says it
	is ok, is a no-op for root anyways. Instead it directly returns a success
	status without doing anything when called by a root process.

	Release our keyboard grab when we're going to invoke the usb acl helper
	The usb acl helper asks policykit, which may want to interact with the
	user through the policykit agent, which wants to grab the keyboard, if
	we then have the keyboard grabbed, the agent says authentication has failed,
	policykit rejects the helper opening up the acl and usbredir won't work.

	Unfortunately the only way to work around this is to temporarily release our
	own keyboard grab, not pretty but as discussed on irc, this is the "best"
	solution.

2011-11-16  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	Add a suid root helper to open usb device nodes
	spice-client needs to be able to open the device nodes under /dev/bus/usb
	to be able to redirect a usb device to the guest. Normally opening these
	nodes is only allowed by root. This patch adds a suid root helper which
	asks policykit if it is ok to grant raw usb device access, and if policykit
	says it is ok, opens up the acl so that the spice-client can open the device
	node.

	As soon as spice-client closes the stdin of the helper, the helper removes
	the extra rights. This ensures that the acl gets put back to normal even if
	the spice client crashes. Normally the spice-client closes stdin directly
	after opening the device node.

	channel-usbredir: Make spice_usbredir_channel_connect async
	With the (upcoming) introduction of the usb device node acl helper, which
	uses policykit, spice_usbredir_channel_connect() may take a long time as
	it will be waiting for the helper, which will be waiting for policykit which
	may be interacting with the user -> Make spice_usbredir_channel_connect() async

	Note that this patch only changes spice_usbredir_channel_connect's
	API to use the standard GIO async API, it is not actually async after this
	patch since it does not yet call the acl helper.

	usb-device-manager: Make spice_usb_device_manager_connect_device async
	With the (upcoming) introduction of the usb device node acl helper, which
	uses policykit, spice_usbredir_channel_connect() may take a long time as
	it will be waiting for the helper, which will be waiting for policykit which
	may be interacting with the user. So spice_usbredir_channel_connect() will
	need to become async, and since spice_usb_device_manager_connect_device
	calls spice_usbredir_channel_connect it thus also needs to become async.

	Note that this patch only changes spice_usb_device_manager_connect_device's
	API to use the standard GIO async API, it is not actually async after this
	patch since spice_usbredir_channel_connect is not yet async.

	channel-usbredir: Move usb device opening into a helper function
	This is a preparation patch for adding the usb device node acl helper

	channel-usbredir: Do disconnect from dispose instead of from finalize

	We are going to deprecate spice_audio_new()

	- SpiceAudio is an abstract class,
	  so it can't have a ctor
	- SpiceAudio should be a singleton,
	  associated with the session lifetime
	- SpiceSession should have a enable-audio property,
	  internal code should be able to access the audio object

	That way of getting the audio object is similar to the smartcard manager and usb manager.

	I didn't add '/' to the list of the other characters to ignore (?;&)
	by intention since an URL like spice://host/?port=5901/somotherstuff
	should not be valid, resp. the password may contain '/' because the
	string is already unescaped at that point.

	Unfortunately glib does not seem to have functions to 'explode' an URI
	which would be really helpful.

2011-10-07  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	decode-glz: Handle needing glz images before they have arrived
	With multi monitor guests, it is possible for a glz-image to refer to
	bits from another glz-image which has not arrived yet! This can happen
	because each monitor has its own display channel, and thus its own socket,
	but they share the glz dict. Thus things can arrive out of order, with a
	glz-image on display 1 arriving before the glz-image on display 2 which it
	refers too.

	This triggers the:
	g_return_val_if_fail(w->images[slot]->hdr.id == id - dist, NULL);

	In glz_decoder_window_bits(), which is what caused me to debug this, once
	the out order thing was clear, so was the fix.
	If w->images[slot]->hdr.id == id - dist is not true, we need to wait for the
	correct image to arrive.

	The out of order issue with multiple monitors can also trigger the
	g_warn_if_reached() in glz_decoder_window_resize(), so remove that.

	SpiceDisplay: Pass on notify signal from GtkSession for GtkSession properties
	Since some SpiceDisplay properties are now just a pass through to the
	equivalent SpiceGtkSession property, we also need to pass on the notify
	signal for these, so interested users can get notified of them changing.

	Use this in spicy to ensure that changes to SpiceGtkSession (and thus per
	session rather then per window) properties get reflected in all windows for
	a multimonitor guest.

	usb-device-manager: One instance per session instead of a singleton
	Since usb device manager keeps track of which usb channels there are and
	if they have usb devices attached there should be one usb-device-manager
	instance per session, rather then one global singleton.

	Tying the usb-device-manager to the session also allows us to get rid of
	spice_usb_device_manager_[un]register_channel and the need for SpiceDisplay
	to call these.

2011-10-06  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	SpiceDisplay: Add a constructor and construction properties
	With SpiceDisplay now passing through auto-clipboard settings to
	SpiceGtkSession, it needs to have its SpiceSession and SpiceGtkSession
	private members initalized at construction time, as
	spice_display_set_property() gets called at construction time.

	Currently its SpiceSession and SpiceGtkSession are NULL when that
	happens leading to the g_object_set() calls in spice_display_set_property()
	triggering g_return_if_fail statements inside glib and rightly complaining
	loudly.

	This patch fixes this by making the SpiceSession and channel ID construction
	properties and passing them to the g_object_new call in spice_display_new.

	Move clipboard handling to SpiceGtkSession
	This fixes copy and paste with multi-monitor guests. There still is
	one small issue left with this patch, changing the setting for auto-clipboard
	in one spicy window, does not get reflected in the Options menu of the
	other spicy windows.

	This can be fixed by listening to the notify signal, this also requires
	SpiceDisplay to listen to property changes on its SpiceGtkSession and
	then do a g_object_set on itself to update its own property (and also
	emit its own notify signal.

	I'll write a separate patch for this.

	Add a SpiceGtkSession Class
	This initial commit of the SpiceGtkSession Class only adds the empty
	class and the 1:1 linkage to SpiceSession through 2 new private methods
	added to SpiceSession: spice_session_{get|set}_gtk_session.

	The following commits will move things which are currently per SpiceDisplay,
	but which really should be global, such as the clipboard, over to
	SpiceGtkSession.

	spice_codegen: Always write a channels entry for an ifdef-ed channel
	Before this patch, if a channel is defined conditionally in spice.proto
	(because it depends on external headers like the smartcard channel),
	spice_codegen would write an entry to the channels array in
	spice_get_*_channel_parser which would only take up a place in the array
	if the ifdef condition is true, thus moving up all other intializers
	one place when it is not true. This was causing issues (crashes) when building
	spice-gtk with the combination of usbredir support enabled and smartcard
	support disabled.

	This patch fixes this by adding #else { NULL, 0 }, to the generated code.

	gtk/Makefile.am: Better explicit deps fro autogenerated files
	Auto-generated files need explicit deps on them to ensure things
	are build in the right order when doing things like make -j200:
	1) We had an explicit deps on spice-marshal.h, but only for spice-channel.c,
	   but others need it to
	2) autogen.c files need autogen.h, note this is done in a separate make
	   statement, since the deps of the actual build rule are used during the
	   generation!
	3) Group all the autogen explicit deps together

	configure.ac: Update minimum required spice-protocol to 0.9.0
	This is needed for usbredir support.

	gtk/continuation.c: undef _FORTIFY_SOURCE earlier
	We need to undef _FORTIFY_SOURCE before our first include, so as to
	avoid the extra checks it does on longjmp which don't play well with
	our coroutine stuff.

	gtk/controller/Makefile.am: Add explicit rules for autogenerated files
	The autogenerated files are part of make dist, without these explicit
	rules doing "./autogen.sh && make dist" on a clean git checkout
	will fail because it wants them but does not know how to build them.

	gtk/Makefile.am: Remove a bunch of .c files from EXTRA_DIST
	automake is smart enough to add _SOURCES files to make dist's result even
	if there compilation is depending on an AM conditional, and we are already
	depending on this for the smartcard / usb files, so lets depend on it for
	the other ones too.

	gtk/Makefile.am: Don't include auto-generated files into make dist tarbal
	We have various files which are auto-generated which currently get included
	into the tarbal, yet they are part of CLEANFILES, so the first make clean
	removes them, which is rather weird. Use nodist_foo_SOURCES to make them
	not end up in the tarbal.

	generated_[de]marshallers[1].c, are special as autogenerating those on
	end user builds would mean requiring the end user to have pyparser installed,
	so we add them to EXTRA_DIST and remove them from CLEANFILES. It may seem
	weird to have them in nodist_... and then add them to EXTRA_DIST,
	but this patch also adds an explict depenency on the autogenerated files
	to the non autogerated ones:
	$(libspice_client_glib_2_0_la_SOURCES): spice-glib-enums.h

	Leaving generated_[de]marshallers[1].c in libspice_client_glib_2_0_la_SOURCES,
	would cause it to get a dep on autogenerated files, and thus get regenerated
	itself no matter what, defeating the purpose of having them in dist in the
	first place.

	3) Fix the existing callers to actually g_free the result of
	   spice_usb_device_get_description. To avoid code duplication this patch
	   makes usb-device-manager prefix the error it gets from the usbredir-channel,
	   so that users of the auto-connect-failed signal can use the error as is.

	usbredir: provide out own libusb_strerror for now
	libusb_strerror is not going upstream because of i18n worries, provide
	our own for now.

	usb-device-manager: Add a auto-connect-failed signal
	And use it in spicy to inform users of auto redirect failures (usually due
	to insufficient rights on the /dev/bus/usb device nodes).

	usb-device-manager: Add a spice_usb_device_get_description() method
	This is just a place holder for now. A better implementation requires
	gusb changes, and I hope there will be an official gusb release by the
	time I get around to fixing this up.

	Drop VOID:BOXED user marshaller
	We were generating a user marshaller for VOID:BOXED, but there is a standard
	marshaller for that, use that instead.

	doc: various improvements

	doc: update to include USB redirection

2011-08-30  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	Remove spice-client-gtk.defs from git (as it is auto-generated)
	spice-client-gtk.defs gets autogenerated (but only when building for
	gtk2). Having it in git means having to keep it in sync with the public
	API manually, which requires doing a gtk2 build before committing each
	time one makes changes to the public API.

	As with any autogenerated files, this really does not belong in git,
	removing it from git removes the need for the manual syncing.

	Also add it to make clean, and change gtk/Makefile.am so that
	the contents on EXTRA_DIST don't depend on how ./configure was run
	making "make dist"-s result depend on ./configure flags is not a good idea.

	Remove gtk/.gitignore
	gtk/.gitignore gets autogenerated and thus should not be part of git.

	It currently being part of git is esp. annoying since depending on
	wether you're building for gtk2 or gtk3, lines like:
	/SpiceClientGtk-2.0.gir
	/SpiceClientGtk-2.0.typelib
	/libspice-client-gtk-2.0.la

	Keep disappearing from it, leading to these changes accidentally
	getting included into whatever commit your working on.

	spice_gstaudio: s/SpiceGstAudio/SpiceGstaudio
	We should either have SpiceGstAudio && spice_gst_audio or
	SpiceGstaudio && spice_gstaudio, not SpiceGstAudio && spice_gstaudio
	like we have today. This patch fixes this by replacing SpiceGstAudio
	with SpiceGstaudio. We can do this since this is only used internally.

	Rename my_foo private datatypes to MyFooPrivate
	We were using the gobject standard notation of MyFooPrivate everywhere
	except for 3 places, this brings these 3 into sync, with what we do elsewhere.

	Add auto_usbredir property to spice-widget

	spice-session: at a spice_session_has_channel_type method

	Add an USB device manager

	Add an usbredir channel

	Add a private copy of gusb
	While working on usb redirection support for spice-gtk I needed some
	code to integrate libusb into glib's mainloop amongst other things. I ended
	up borrowing code from colord for this. Richard (the colord author) and I
	quickly agreed that doing generic glib bindings for libusb is a good idea,
	akin to the gudev bindings for libudev we've called our WIP on this gusb:
	https://gitorious.org/gusb

	Since this very much is a WIP, the API is nowere near stable, so for now
	we bundle a copy of this code with spice-gtk. When gusb has an official
	release out the door with a stable API we should switch to that.

	spice.proto: Add usbredir channel

	spice-channel: Reset SPICE_COMMON_CAP_PROTOCOL_AUTH_SELECTION on disconnect
	Our disconnect handler clears the common_caps array so that a new
	connection starts with a clean slate. But in our constructor we set
	the SPICE_COMMON_CAP_PROTOCOL_AUTH_SELECTION in common_caps as starting
	cap. Do the same on disconnect, so the behavior of a re-using a channel
	after disconnect is the same as using a fresh channel.

2011-08-17  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	spice-channel: fix writing a byte twice when a write blocks
	When a write blocks, and thus ret == -1 (and the gerror matches EAGAIN) we
	still do offset += ret, causing the last written byte to be send twice.
	Lets not do that :)

	spice-widget: release_keys on focus out
	This fixes alt getting stuck in the guest when the user alt-tabs away from the
	spice-widget (thus making it see the alt press but not the release) and then
	closing it without giving it the focus back (by using the windows close button
	for example).

	Note that doing this on focus out (when we know we may be missing key releases
	afterwards) makes a lot more sense then doing this on focus in, and with
	the release_keys on focus out I don't really see a reason any more to do it
	on focus in. But I'm leaving it in on focus in just in case, it certainly
	cannot hurt there.

	spice-widget: remove keyboard_grab_count / keyboard_grab_time hack
	With the filtering of focus in / out events caused by grabs we should no
	longer need this.

	spice-widget: ignore focus in / out events caused by keyb ungrab/grab
	As documented in XGrabKeyboard(3): "The XGrabKeyboard function actively grabs
	control of the keyboard and generates FocusIn and FocusOut events."

	Note that for some reason this only happens when we call XGrabKeyboard
	from our enter_event / leave_event callbacks and not from our focus_in /
	focus_out callbacks? Either way we still need to filter these out.

	Filtering these out fixes 4 issues:
	1) keyboard_have_focus now no longer gets unset when the keyboard is grabbed,
	   making USB auto redirection when focussed actually work
	2) Before this patch, if you pressed alt and then (accidentally) moved the
	   cursor out of the spice-widget window before pressing a second key,
	   the focus in event would clear the keyboard status causing the guest to no
	   longer see alt as pressed and register the second key press as a regular
	   keypress rather then as alt-foo.
	3) It allows us to remove the keyboard_grab_count / keyboard_grab_time hack
	   from try_keyboard_grab, although since we are no longer doing an
	   ungrab on focus out, this likely could have been removed before.
	   I will do this in a separate patch for easier reverting if necessary.

	spice-channel: Fix a possible race triggered by spice_channel_iterate_write

	mjpeg: don't leak last stream image
	When a stream is destroy, the memory allocated to handle the mjpeg
	decoding is freed by calling stream_mjpeg_cleanup. However, the
	memory allocated to contain the last uncompressed stream image
	wasn't freed.

	mjpeg: remove wrong g_return_if_fail
	After calling jpeg_read_scanlines, spice-gtk checks that we read
	the amount of lines we expected, and if not, it returns early.
	This is doubly wrong:

	* jpeg_read_scanlines is documented as returning at most the number
	of lines requested, but it also warns that an application shouldn't
	rely on getting exactly the number of scanlines requested. In this
	case, if rec_outbuf_height is bigger than 1, we'll get a short read
	on the last line of odd-sized images, thus triggering the
	g_return_if_fail

	* returning from this function without calling jpeg_abort will cause
	libjpeg to abort next time we use it because jpeg_start_decompress
	was called before

	This commit removes this check and early return.

	mjpeg: restrict use of i and j
	Using i and j as variable names that are used from one loop to the
	other isn't really readable, and makes the code more fragile than
	it could be. This commits adds a "lines_read" variable which is more
	expressive than "j", restricts "j" lifetime to the loop where it's
	used, and it removes the "i" variable and uses counters provided
	by libjpeg to iterate all the image lines.
	It also has the side-effect that if jpeg_read_scanlines returns a short
	read (less lines than expected are read), "dest" won't go out of sync but
	will be set to the right place at the end of the loop.

	mjpeg: properly abort decompression in error path
	spice-gtk jpeg decompression code honors libjpeg's recommended size
	for its output buffer to improve performance. However, when this
	recommended size is too big, it just gives up on the decompression
	process by returning early from the function. But since
	jpeg_start_decompress has been called to compute this recommended
	size, the decompression must be aborted before returning, otherwise
	libjpeg will get in an inconsistent state and will abort next time
	we try to use it.
	This commit also moves the check that the recommended size isn't
	too big out of the decompression loop because it shouldn't changed
	during decompression.

	People starting spicy will not always want their smartcard data
	to be forwarded to the guest they're connecting to. Currently,
	smartcard events are unconditionnally forwarded to the server if
	spicy was compiled with smartcard support. This commit adds a
	--smartcard option that must be used in order to enable smartcard
	support in the client. By default, smartcard data won't be forwarded
	to the server unless this option is specified.

	use new @ifdef directive for smartcard messages
	We don't want to conditionally compile the smartcard messages

	the @ifdef attribute for that.

	handle @ifdef on messages and channels

	allow attributes on channel elements in .proto files
	We want to be able to add an @ifdef annotation to optional messages
	For example, we want to compile in the smartcard messages only if
	libcacard is available

	add ifdef/endif methods to spice code generator
	These methods will be needed to be able to make some fields optional
	in spice.proto

	fix compilation when libcacard isn't installed

	set menu actions sensitivity for software smartcards
	Make sure menu actions are only sensitive when we are using a
	software smartcard reader, and properly update the sensitivity
	depending on the presence or not of a software smartcard in the
	software reader.

	add smartcard actions to spicy
	Add code to add/remove a software smartcard in spicy UI. These
	2 entries were added as items in the Input menu. They are not
	grayed out for now if there is no software reader available.

	add software smartcard reader support

	use user-provided certificates when init'ing libcacard

	read certificate information from command line
	When using a software card reader, one needs to pass 3 certificates
	to be used to simulate the smartcard (and optionnally the path to
	a certificate database). This commit adds support for --certificates
	and --certificate-db command line options to do that.

	add smartcard properties to SpiceSession
	To handle software smartcards, we need to be able to pass the
	certificates to use for the smartcard as well as the database where
	these certificates can be found. This commit adds "certificates"
	and "certificate-db" properties to make this possible.

	handle smartcard channel in SpiceWidget

	handle smartcard channel in spice_channel_new

	initialize libcacard

	don't always serialize messages sent to the server
	The communication between spice clients and servers on the smartcard
	channel can be initiated either by the client or by the server.
	It's initiated by the client for smartcard reader events (reader
	hot(un)plug, card insertion/removal), or it can be initiated by the
	server when it wants to query the certificates available on the
	smartcard.
	When communication is initiated by the client, we want to serialize
	the messages we sent, ie we don't want to send a message if we
	haven't received yet the answer to the previous message.
	However, when it's the server which initiates the communication,
	we don't want to use this serializing mechanism.

	This commit adds a "serialize_msg" boolean to be able to disable
	message sending serialization as needed.

	forward APDU requests from server to smartcard reader
	These requests are sent by the server when trying to read the
	certificates from the smartcard.

	handle messages from spice server

	serialize sending of smartcard channel messages
	Messages sent to the spice server by the smartcard channel have to
	be serialized: before sending a message, the channel has to wait
	for the server answer to the previous message. Add a GQueue to be
	able to queue several messages to the server while we wait for the
	answer to an earlier message.
	I think the reason why that serialization is needed is to be able
	to deterministically assign IDs to readers on reader addition. We
	have no way to match a message from the spice server with the
	message to the server that triggered this reply, which means that
	if we could send several reader additions to the server without
	waiting for answers, when the server answers, we wouldn't know
	which reader it's trying to assign an ID to.

	send messages to spice server on reader/card events

	add basic callbacks for smartcard events
	Now that the smartcard manager sends event for smartcard readers,
	the smartcard channel has to do something with them. For now, we just
	add basic callbacks which don't try to forward these events to the
	spice server. However, we start adding the glue needed to handle
	the fact that plugging of smartcard readers and creation of these
	readers in the spice server will be asynchronous.
	After receiving a "reader addition" command, the spice server sends
	back an ID to identify this reader which must be used in all other
	requests (card insertion, removal and reader removal) to identify
	this reader. However, if the server is slow to send back this ID,
	there's a window when we can get additional events for the reader
	that is being added that we can't send right away to the server
	because we don't know the ID to use. That's why we add the various
	pending_* hashes in this commit, to be able to keep track of the
	requests that will have to be sent once the spice server has
	assigned an ID to the reader.

	add smartcard bits to spice.proto

	emit signals in reaction to libcacard events

	Add signals which will be emitted when a reader appears/disappears,

	add boxed type for VReader
	VReader is a type defined in libcacard which contains all the
	information we need ot handle card readers. Since it's refcounted,
	we can make it a boxed type for use in signals.

	add smartcard monitor GSource
	This source gets events from libcacard and inserts them into
	a regular glib mainloop. The smartcard manager will then emit
	signals in reaction to the events it got from libcacard.

	improve debug log on coroutine start

	factor base message handling in SpiceChannel
	Currently, every channel has to define all the server messages it
	handles, including the "generic" ones. Since it's error prone (easy
	to forget the handling of default messages in new sources), it's
	better to move this handling to the base channel class, and to call
	the parent method when the message is unknown in the ::handle_msg
	method.

	On top of this, another factoring that can be done is to make the
	message handling function generic instead of reimplementing it in
	every class. Each class would only have to register its own
	(class-specific) set of handlers.

	Conflicts:

		gtk/channel-playback.c
		gtk/channel-record.c

	display more options in default --help
	When running spicy --help, very few options are shown. I didn't

	these options more obvious.

	test.
	We probably should check that only one of windows/x11/quartz is
	enabled at once.
	NB: for now the QUARTZ defines are not used since we will be
	using a generic GnomeRR backend instead of having our own
	OSX backend.

	configure.ac: only check for X11 libs on X11 builds
	No need to try to detect xrandr or xkb headers when we won't be
	doing an X11 build. This is even detrimental on Mac OSX when
	we want to attempt a native build but have the xkb headers installed.

	configure.ac: simplify --with-x11 processing a bit

	configure.ac: improve X11 detection
	Use gtk-x11-[23].0.pc to detect whether we want an x11 build or
	not. Don't AC_SUBST X11_CFLAGS and X11_LIBS since they are unused.

	configure.ac: group all X11 checks
	Gather all x11 related checks in the same place

2011-04-08  Hans de Goede  <hdegoede@redhat.com>

	gtk: fixup clipboard_by_guest tracking
	clipboard_by_guest tracking was used more or less for 2 things, to keep track
	if the agent has clipboard data ready to send, and to see if we have done a
	clipboard_set_with_data on behalf of the guest agent.

	This patch splits the tracking of the 2, fixing several issues:
	1) spice_display_paste_from_guest would not work if since receiving
	   the grab from the agent some other app has copied something to
	   the client clipboard.
	2) We would do a clipboard_clear unconditionally even if we were
	   not the clipboard owner in the client (iow some other app has
	   done a clipboard_set_with_data since out last one).

	This patch changes the meaning of the clipboard_by_guest boolean to just
	track if we've done a clipboard_set_with_data on behalf of the guest
	and are the last one to have a done a clipboard_set_with_data (iow we are the
	client os' clipboard owner). It adds a checks to clipboard_release to
	only call clipboard_clear if we are the current ownerm fixing 1).

	This patch uses nclip_targets to keep track of the agent having data
	available which we could paste, fixing 2).

	gtk: Clear hasdata when we do a clipboard_set_with_data
	When we call gtk_clipboard_set_with_data to set the client clipboard
	to the targets reported as available by the agent, the clipboard no
	longer has data in the sense that it has data which is interesting
	for spice_display_copy_to_guest, so clear clip_hasdata whenever we
	call gtk_clipboard_set_with_data,

	gtk: receiving a grab from the agent implies releasing our own
	By setting d->clip_grabbed[selection] to FALSE when we receive a grab from
	the agent, we can remove the weird "if (!d->clipboard_by_guest[selection])"
	check from clipboard_owner_change, and we fix spice_display_copy_to_guest not
	working in the following case:
	1) autoclipboard share disabled
	2) Copy something to the clipboard in the client
	3) Send it to the guest by calling spice_display_copy_to_guest
	4) Copy something to the clipboard in the guest
	5) Tried to send the client clipboard to the guest again by calling
	   spice_display_copy_to_guest (again).

	5) would not work because d->clip_grabbed[selection] would still be true in
	spice-gtk's view, where as the agent no longer sees the clipboard as grabbed
	by the client since it send a grab itself.

	gtk: use a separate var to keep track of self caused new clipboard owner events
	Also change 0/1 to FALSE/TRUE in touched code. spice-widget seems to be
	using all 3 of: 0/1 false/true and FALSE/TRUE for booleans. The glib convention
	is FALSE/TRUE.

	gtk: take selection into account in clipboard_release

2011-04-05  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	gtk: only release clipboard when neither guest nor client own it
	08:55 < hansg> elmarco, this is from vdagent.log with debugging enabled. What is happening is that the last thing done was a primary
	               selection in the client, so vdagent owns the clipboard in the guest (on behalf of spice-gtk), then something gets selected
	               inside the guest, the agent sends a grab to spice-gtk, which then does a gtk_clipboard_set_with_data, this triggers an
	               clipboard_owner_change which sends a release message to the agent
	08:56 < hansg> To which the agent then responds by dropping it, and logging:
	08:56 < hansg> primary: received release while not owning client clipboard
	09:11 < elmarco> hansg: but this bug we are talking about is not related to multi-clipboard right?
	09:11 < elmarco> and it's only a warning in vdagent, things works as expected otherwise, right?
	09:11 < elmarco> the bug was thee before I suppose
	09:12 < hansg> right, they work because vdagent is diligent and sees the client sends a release while it is not owning the clipboard. The
	               diligence is mainly there in case things race though (release on client racing with a grab on guest), not to make things
	               work with buggy clients :)
	09:13 < hansg> wrt: <elmarco> hansg: d->clip_grabbed is only for client-side grab, iirc
	09:13 < elmarco> ok, I think it's just an obscure area of the spec, where basically, we don't define exactly the "state machine"
	09:13 < elmarco> so the client is releasing his last client-side grab, because he had one before, but now, it is a guest grab
	09:13 < hansg> True (not exactly definging the state machine)
	09:14 < hansg> So to try again wrt the  d->clip_grabbed, what happens there (which has the same cause) is:
	09:14 < elmarco> so, what it should do is just don't release the clipboard if it is switching from client-side to guest
	09:15 < hansg> gtk/spice-widget.c: clipboard_grab gets called, and does:
	09:15 < hansg> Hmm, hold on, I see what you mean wrt d->clip_grabbed now
	09:16 < elmarco> to me, it looks like the client made a grab and to complete it's cycle, it should release his grab
	09:16 < elmarco> but the order of things confuse vdagent and we should agree on something and document it
	09:18 < hansg> elmarco, I need some time to take a somewhat closer look at the spice-gtk code in this area, give me 1/2 an hour and I'l
	               get back to you
	09:20 < elmarco> from client 1. grab -> 2. grab <- 3. release -> or 1. grab -> 2. grab <- 3. no release
	09:21 < elmarco> I think state should not be mixed between client grab / release -> and guest grab/release <-
	09:22 < elmarco> so, overriding client grab by guest grab should release client grab
	09:23 < hansg> spicec and the linux agent both assume that after sending a grab they won't get back a release (for that selection). The
	               purpose of the release is to tell the OS that the agent resp,  client no longer own the clipboard (by setting the owner to
	               None under X11), so that other apps can disable their paste menu item, etc. There is no need to do that (and actually
	               doing so would be a bug) if an other app now owns the clipboard. So if the other side claim
	09:23 < hansg> s ownership of the clipboard there is no need to tell it you're releasing your side, since it already assume you have
	09:24 < hansg> Scenarios to keep in mind are:
	09:24 < hansg> Seen from the client side:
	09:28 < hansg> client grabs clipboard
	09:28 < hansg> some app on guest becomes owner, guest sends grab, assume client release
	09:29 < hansg> some app on guest asks agent for clipboard data -> tells it to go away since the client no longer the owner
	09:29 < hansg> If it would not assume the release, there would be a window where it would think the client still owns the clipboard and
	               forward potential request to the client, even though the client no longer owns the clipboard
	09:30 < hansg> The thing to keep in mind is that the delivery of messages is not instant, so there is some window where the 2 sides are
	               out of sync.
	09:30 < hansg> I can see the logic in how you're advocating to do things, but that is not how they are currently done and I'm reluctant
	               to change this
	09:33 < elmarco> hansg: yeah, I don't think one solution or the other affect user experience, for me there is no gap if the client and
	                 agent agrees, it's only protocol/implementation details
	09:33 < elmarco> since there was prior implementation, we can decide to follow it

	spice-gtk configure.ac has some code to detect if the compiler has

	is broken (the gcc attribute name is "warn_unused_result", not

	since spice-protocol provides SPICE_GNUC_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT. Thus
	we can just drop that block of code from configure.ac

	configure.ac: remove unused tests
	configure.ac had -fvisibility detection, but it's not used by
	spice-gtk. It also has a --enable-static-linkage flag which isn't
	used anywhere apart from in configure.ac, so remote this too. I

2011-03-27  Marc-André Lureau  <marcandre.lureau@redhat.com>

	Revert "gtk/display: remove unused mode name"
	This reverts commit 33ef5a9368534f7fcb77ef60d8811ae08a707e4f.

2011-03-23  Christophe Fergeau  <cfergeau@gmail.com>

	gtk/display: be more paranoid about potentially NULL pointer
	If things don't go as expected in gnome_rr_config_ensure_primary
	(for example we don't find any usable output), we may end up
	trying to dereference a NULL pointer. It's better to check
	top_left is not NULL before using it.

	gtk: don't attempt to dereference NULL pointer
	In spice_channel_handle_migrate there's an explicit check for
	data being NULL. However, we subsequently dereference it twice
	even when it can be NULL. Add explicit checks to avoid that.

	gtk: remove unused variables
	They were spotted by the clang static analyzer.

	Fix rendering with GTK3
	In GTK2 world there is an expose_event handler, so a choice
	of the X11 or cairo backends can be used.

	In GTK3 world only the draw_event exists, which must use
	cairo

	Disallow python module and X11 rendering with GTK3
	In GTK3 the python binding is provided via introspection.
	The X11 rendering code is not compatible with GTK3 since
	all GTK3 drawing is cairo based and there is no expose_event
	any more

	Make keyboard code support multiple GDK backends
	Adapt the keyboard code so that it builds with GTK2 and GTK3,
	where the latter has multiple GDK backends

	Fix use of GdkDrawable to be compat with GTK3
	In GTK3, the GdkDrawable class is gone, leaving only GdkWindow.
	The GdkDrawable class can be mostly avoided in Gtk2, thus
	eliminating the compat problems with Gtk3. Only a couple of
	compat calls need to be added to allow compilation on both.

	Adapt build system to allow building with GTK3
	The new configure flag '--with-gtk' can be used to choose
	which GTK version to build against, defaulting to GTK2.
	To enable GTK3 use

	   ./configure --with-gtk=3.0

	The libspice-client-glib-2.0.la library is unchanged, building
	against glib-2.0 at all times.

	The GTK3 build will produce a libspice-client-gtk-3.0.la
	The include files will also live in $prefix/spice-client-gtk-3.0
	and the pkgconfig is called spice-client-gtk-3.0 too.

	This allows for full parallel install of GTK2 and GTK3 builds

	Include ABI version in library names.
	To allow easy parallel install of spice-gtk builds against GTK2
	and GTK3, include the ABI version in the library names.

	 libspice-gtk.la -> libspice-gtk-2.0.la
	 libspice-glib.la -> libspice-glib-2.0.la

	The PyGtk module doesn't change because that is obsolete and
	unused in GTK3 world.

	build: use git-version-gen

	README: add a few missing dependencies

	gtk: disconnect record stream when record_stop()
	This behaviour is different than playback. The main difference is that
	a playback stream will stay active, while the recording stream will be
	removed: that way the GNOME volume control can notice the user there
	is no active recording, by hiding the microphone icon.

	Playback is more frequent (sounds events...) and it would be
	unfriendly if the stream was removed/added every now and then from the
	volume control list.

	build: update build depedencies

	build: update README

	po: add fr translation
