Introduction
============

Spice is an open remote computing solution, providing client access to
remote displays and devices (e.g. keyboard, mouse, audio). The main
use case is to get remote access to virtual machines, although other
use cases are possible and in various development stage.

Spice provides a desktop-like user experience, while trying to offload
most of the intensive CPU and GPU tasks to the client. The basic
building blocks of Spice are:

 * <<spice-server, Spice Server>>
 * <<spice-client, Spice Client>>
 * <<spice-protocol, Spice Protocol>>

The following sections provide basic information on Spice components
and features, obtaining, building installing and using Spice.

Spice and Spice-related components
----------------------------------

[[spice-server]]
Spice Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spice server is implemented in libspice, a VDI pluggable
library. Currently, the main user of this library is QEMU. QEMU uses
spice-server to provide remote access to virtual machines through the
Spice protocol. Virtual Device Interface (VDI) defines a set of
interfaces that provide a standard way to publish virtual devices
(e.g. display device, keyboard, mouse) and enables different Spice
components to interact with those devices. On one side, the server
communicates with the remote client using the Spice protocol and on
the other side, it interacts with the VDI host application (e.g QEMU).

[[spice-client]]
Spice Client
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Spice client is a program which is used by the end user to access
remote systems through Spice. The recommended client is remote-viewer
(which is shipped with virt-viewer). GNOME Boxes can also be used as a
Spice client. spicec is an obsolete legacy client, and spicy is only a
test application.

QXL Device and Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spice server supports the QXL VDI interface. When libspice is used
with QEMU, a specific video PCI device can be used for improving
remote display performance and enhancing the graphic capabilities of
the guest graphic system. This video device is called a QXL device and
requires guest QXL drivers for full functionality. However, standard
VGA is supported when no driver exists.

Spice Agent
~~~~~~~~~~~

The Spice agent is an optional component for enhancing user experience
and performing guest-oriented management tasks. For example, the agent
injects mouse position and state to the guest when using client mouse
mode. It also enables you to move cursor freely between guest and
client. Other features of agent are shared clipboard (copy and paste
between guest and host) and aligning guest resolution with client when
entering fullscreen mode.

VDI Port Device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Spice protocol supports a communication channel between the client
and the agent on the server side. When using QEMU, Spice agent resides
on the guest. VDI port is a QEMU PCI device used for communication
with the agent.

[[spice-protocol]]
Spice Protocol
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Spice protocol defines the messages and rules for the
communication between the various Spice components.

Features
--------

Multiple Channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The server and client communicate via channels. Each channel is
dedicated to a specific type of data. The available channels are the
following:

Main::
control and configuration

Display::
graphics commands images and video streams

Inputs::
keyboard and mouse inputs

Cursor::
pointer device position and cursor shape

Playback::
audio received from the server to be played by the client

Record::
audio captured on the client side

Smartcard::
passthrough of smartcard data from the client machine to the guest OS

USB::
redirection of USB devices plugged into the client to the guest OS

Image Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spice offers several image compression algorithms, which can be chosen
on server initiation and dynamically at run-time. Quic is a Spice
proprietary image compression technology based on the SFALIC
algorithm. The Lempel-Ziv (LZ) algorithm is another option. Both Quic
and LZ are local algorithms encoding each image separately. Global LZ
(GLZ) is another proprietary Spice technology that uses LZ with
history-based global dictionary. GLZ takes advantage of repeating
patterns among images to shrink the traffic and save bandwidth, which
is critical in a WAN environment. Spice also offers an automatic mode
for compression selection per image, where the choice between LZ/GLZ
and Quic is heuristically based on image properties. Conceptually,
synthetic images are better compressed with LZ/GLZ and real images are
better with Quic.

Video Compression
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Spice uses loss-less compression for images sent to the
client. However, video streams are handled differently. Spice server
heuristically identifies video areas and sends them as a video stream
coded using M-JPEG. This handling saves a lot of traffic, improving
Spice performance, especially in a WAN environment. However, in some
circumstances the heuristic behavior might cause low quality images
(e.g. identifying updated text area as a video stream). Video
streaming can be chosen on server initiation and dynamically at
run-time.

Mouse modes
~~~~~~~~~~~

Spice supports two mouse modes: server and client. The mode can be
changed dynamically and is negotiated between the client and the
server.

Server mouse::
When a user clicks inside the Spice client window, the client mouse is
captured and set invisible. In this mode, the server controls the
mouse position on display. However, it might be problematic on WAN or
on a loaded server, where mouse cursor might have some latency or
non-responsiveness.

Client mouse::
Not captured and is used as the effective pointing device. To enable
client mouse, the VDI host application must register an absolute
pointing device (e.g. USB tablet in QEMU). This mode is appropriate
for WAN or or for a loaded server, since cursor has smooth motion and
responsiveness. However, the cursor might lose synchronization
(position and shape) for a while.

Other Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple Monitors::
any number of monitors is supported

Arbitrary Resolution::
when using the QXL driver, the resolution of the guest OS will be
automatically adjusted to the size of the client window.

USB Redirection::
Spice can be used to redirect USB devices that are plugged in the
client to the guest OS. This redirection can either be automatic (all
newly plugged devices are redirected), or manual (the user selects
which devices (s)he wants to redirect).

Smartcard Redirection::
data from smartcard that are inserted into the client machine can be
passed through to the guest OS. The smartcard can be used by both the
client OS and the guest OS.

Bidirectional Audio::
Spice supports audio playback and recording. Playback is compressed
using the CELT algorithm

Lip-sync::
between video and audio. Available only when video streaming is
enabled.

Migration::
switching channel connectivity for supporting server migration

Pixmap and Palette caching::
image data is cached on the client to avoid sending the same data

Using Spice
===========

[NOTE]
I'll use `qemu-kvm` as a name for the executable. If you're using a
manually built qemu or a qemu without kvm then just replace `qemu-kvm`
with your own binary. I'll use `host$`, `client$` and `guest$` shell
prompt notations to distinguish where the command should be the
command. See section <<glossary>> to be sure that you know
difference between the host, client and guest. You can ignore the
difference between guest, client and host if they are all running on
the same machine.

Running qemu manually
---------------------

*The first thing to do* is to create a guest image. You can use any
raw device such as a clean logical volume, or an iSCSI lun. You may
also use a file as the disk image for the guest. I'll use a file
created by `qemu-img` as a demonstration.

The following command will allocate a 10GB file. See `qemu-img` man
page for further information.

[source,sh]
host$ qemu-img create /path/to/xp.img 10G

Now that we created an image, we can now start with image
population. I assume that you have a locally stored ISO of your
favourite operating system so you can use it for installation.

[source,sh]
host$ sudo qemu-kvm -boot order=dc -vga qxl \
        -spice port=3001,disable-ticketing -soundhw ac97 \
        -device virtio-serial -chardev spicevmc,id=vdagent,debug=0,name=vdagent \
        -device virtserialport,chardev=vdagent,name=com.redhat.spice.0 \
        -cdrom /path/to/your.iso /path/to/your.img


Let's take a brief look at the qemu options that were used. The option
`-boot order=dc` specifies that the guest system should try to boot
from the first cdrom and then fallback to the first disk, `-vga qxl`
specifies that qemu uses a qxl graphics device.

The Spice `port` option defines what port will be used for
communication with the client. The Spice option `disable-ticketing` is
specifying that ticketing (simple authentication method) is not
used. The virtio and chardev devices are required by the guest agent.

Basic configuration
-------------------

This section will assume that you already have a running QEMU virtual
machine, and that you are running it either through virt-manager,
libvirt or through direct QEMU use, and that you want to enable Spice
support for this virtual machine.

.Using virt-manager

Double-click on the virtual machine you are interested in, go to
"View/Details". If the left pane has a "Display Spice" entry, then the
virtual machine already has Spice support, and you can check the
connection details (port number) by clicking on it. If it has no Spice
entry, click on "Add Hardware", and add a "Graphics" element of type
"Spice server". If the host and the client are not the same machine,
you should check the "Listen on all public network interfaces"
checkbox, otherwise you don't need to make any changes.

You should also add a QXL video device. It can be done by
double-clicking on a virtual machine, then by going to View/Details,
and by clicking on "Add Hardware" if the virtual machine does not have
a "Video QXL" item in its left pane. From the "Add hardware" dialog,
you should then create a "Video" device whose model is "QXL".

After stopping and restarting the virtual machine, it should be
accessible with a Spice client.

You can remove non-Spice display entries and non-QXL video entries
from the virtual machine configuration.

If you go to "Edit/Preferences/VM Details" in the main virt-manager
window, you can set Spice graphics type as the default setting for new
virtual machines.

.Using libvirt

All libvirt examples will assume that the virtual machine to modify is
`$vmname` and that virsh is using the correct libvirt connection by
default.

To add Spice support to an existing virtual machine managed by
libvirt, you need to edit it:

[source,sh]
host$ virsh edit $vmname

and then add a Spice graphics element:

[source,xml]
<graphics type='spice'/>

You should also add a QXL video device

[source,xml]
<video>
    <model type='qxl'>
</video>

After stopping and restarting the virtual machine `$vmname`, it should
be accessible through Spice. You can check the connection parameters
with:

[source,sh]
host$ virsh domdisplay $vmname

.Using QEMU

To enable Spice support to your virtual machine, you only need to
append the following to your QEMU command line:

[source,sh]
-spice port=3001,disable-ticketing

This will setup a Spice session listening on port 3001 exporting your
virtual machine display.

You can also add a QXL device by appending `-vga qxl` to the command
line.

Connecting to the guest
-----------------------

The following section will show you basic usage of the Spice
client. The example connection will be related to the qemu instance
started in the previous sections.

Be aware that the port used for spice communication (port 3001 in our
case) should not be blocked by firewall. Host `myhost` is referring to
the machine which is running our qemu instance.

[source,sh]
client$ remote-viewer spice://myhost:3001

.Established connection to Windows 2008 guest
image::images/spicec01.png[]


Ticketing
=========

Spice does not support multiple connections to the same QEMU instance
by default. So anybody who will connect to the same host and port can
simply take over your session. You can solve this problem by using
ticketing.

Ticketing is a simple authentication system which enables you to set
simple tickets to a VM. Client has to authenticate before the
connection can be established. See the Spice option `password` in the
following examples.

Configuration
-------------

.Using virt-manager

To set a Spice password for a virtual machine, go to this machine
details in virt-manager, and then click on the "Display Spice" item in
the left pane, and enter the ticket you want to use in the "Password"
field.

.Using libvirt

All you need to do is to append a `passwd` attribute to the Spice
graphics node for your virtual machine:

[source,xml]
<graphics type='spice' passwd='mysecretpassword'/>

.Using QEMU

Adding a ticket with QEMU involves a slight modification of the
`-spice` parameter used when running QEMU:

[source,sh]
-spice port=3001,password=mysecretpassword

Client
------

When you start the client as usual, if ticketing was enabled on the
host, remote-viewer will pop up a window asking for a password before
starting the Spice session. It won't be established if an incorrect
ticket was passed to the client.

IMPORTANT: You might have figured out that passing tickets as a
command-line option isn't very safe. It's not safe as everybody with
access to the host can read it from the output of `ps(1)`. To prevent
this, the ticket can be also set by using the QEMU console command
`spice._set_ticket`.


[[agent]]
Agent
=====

Agent support allows better integration with the guest. For example,
it allows copy and paste between the guest and the host OSes, dynamic
resolution changes when the client window is resized/full-screened,
file transfers through drag and drop, ...

The agent is a daemon/service running in the guest OS so it must be
installed if it was not installed by default during the guest OS
installation. It also relies on a virtio-serial PCI device and a
dedicated spicevmc char device to achieve communication between the
guest and the host. These devices must be added to the virtual machine
for the agent to work in the guest.

Configuration
-------------

.Using virt-manager

The needed devices can be added from the virtual machine
details. Click on "Add hardware" and then add a "Channel" device with
type "Spice agent (spicevmc)". This will automatically add the needed
virtio-serial device in addition to the spicevmc channel.

.Using libvirt

Two distinct devices must be added:

* http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsControllers[a virtio serial device]
* http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementCharChannel[a spicevmc channel]

[source,xml]
<devices>
    <controller type='virtio-serial' index='0'/>
    <channel type='spicevmc'>
        <target type='virtio' name='com.redhat.spice.0'/>
    </channel>
</devices>

.Using QEMU

Adding the following parameters to your QEMU command line will enable
the needed devices for agent support in the guest OS:

[source,sh]
-device virtio-serial \
-chardev spicevmc,id=vdagent,debug=0,name=vdagent \
-device virtserialport,chardev=vdagent,name=com.redhat.spice.0 \

USB redirection
===============

With USB redirection, USB devices plugged into the client machine can
be transparently redirected to the guest OS. This redirection can
either be automatic (all newly plugged devices are redirected), or
manual (the user selects which devices (s)he wants to redirect).

For redirection to work, the virtual machine must have an USB2 EHCI
controller (this implies 3 additional UHCI controllers). It also needs
to have Spice channels for USB redirection. The number of such
channels correspond to the number of USB devices that it will be
possible to redirect at the same time.

Configuration
-------------

.Using virt-manager

Virtual machines created with virt-manager should have a USB
controller by default. In the virtual machine details, select
"Controller USB" in the left pane, and make sure its model is set to
USB2. You can then click on "Add Hardware" and add as many "USB
Redirection" items as the number of USB devices you want to be able to
redirect simultaneously.

.Using libvirt

You need to add the needed USB controllers to the libvirt XML (make
sure there is no pre-existing USB controller in your virtual machine
XML before doing this), as well as one Spice USB redirection channel
per device you want to redirect simultaneously.

[source,xml]
<controller type='usb' index='0' model='ich9-ehci1'/>
<controller type='usb' index='0' model='ich9-uhci1'>
    <master startport='0'/>
</controller>
<controller type='usb' index='0' model='ich9-uhci2'>
    <master startport='2'/>
</controller>
<controller type='usb' index='0' model='ich9-uhci3'>
    <master startport='4'/>
</controller>
<redirdev bus='usb' type='spicevmc'/>
<redirdev bus='usb' type='spicevmc'/>
<redirdev bus='usb' type='spicevmc'/>
<redirdev bus='usb' type='spicevmc'/>

.Using QEMU

Similarly to libvirt, we need to add EHCI/UHCI controllers to QEMU
command line, and we also need to add one Spice redirection channel
per device we want to redirect simultaneously.

[source,sh]
-device ich9-usb-ehci1,id=usb \
-device ich9-usb-uhci1,masterbus=usb.0,firstport=0,multifunction=on \
-device ich9-usb-uhci2,masterbus=usb.0,firstport=2 \
-device ich9-usb-uhci3,masterbus=usb.0,firstport=4 \
-chardev spicevmc,name=usbredir,id=usbredirchardev1 \
-device usb-redir,chardev=usbredirchardev1,id=usbredirdev1 \
-chardev spicevmc,name=usbredir,id=usbredirchardev2 \
-device usb-redir,chardev=usbredirchardev2,id=usbredirdev2 \
-chardev spicevmc,name=usbredir,id=usbredirchardev3 \
-device usb-redir,chardev=usbredirchardev3,id=usbredirdev3

Client
------

The client needs to have support for USB redirection. In
remote-viewer, you can select which USB devices to redirect in
"File/USB device" selection once the Spice connection is
established. There are also various command line redirection options
which are described when running remote-viewer with `--help-spice`.

[NOTE]
You may need additional services running in the client, such as the
Spice USB Clerk service on Windows.

Multiple monitor support
========================

When using Spice, it's possible to use multiple monitors. For that,
the guest must have multiple QXL devices (for Windows guests), or a
single QXL device configured to support multiple heads (for Linux
guests).

Before following the instructions in this section, make sure your
virtual machine already has a QXL device. If that is not the case,
refer to this section. Your guest OS will also need to have the QXL
driver installed or multiple monitor support will not work.

Once your virtual machine is using a QXL device, you don't need to
make any other change to get multiple heads in a Linux guest. The
following paragraph will deal with adding multiple QXL devices to get
multiple monitors in a Windows guest.

Configuration
-------------

.Using virt-manager

To add an additional QXL device for Windows guests, simply go to your
virtual machine details. Check that you already have a "Video QXL"
device, if notclick on "Add Hardware", and add a "Video" device with
model "QXL". This can also work with Linux guests if your are willing
to configure X.Org to use Xinerama (instead of XRandR).

If you are using a new enough distribution (for example Fedora 19),
and if your virtual machine already has a QXL device, you should not
need to make any changes in virt-manager. If you are using an older
distribution, you can't do the required changes from virt-manager,
you'll need to edit libvirt XML as described on this blog post.

.Using libvirt

To add an additional QXL device to your virtual machine managed by
libvirt, you simply need to append a new video node whose model is
QXL:

[source,xml]
<video>
    <model type='qxl'>
</video>
<video>
    <model type='qxl'>
</video>


.Using QEMU

To get a second QXL device in your virtual machine, you need to append
`-device qxl` to your QEMU command line in addition to the `-vga qxl`
that is already there:

[source,sh]
-vga qxl -device qxl

Client
------

You can enable additional displays either from the "Display/Displays"
menu in remote-viewer, or from your guest OS display configuration
tool.

TLS
===

TLS support allows to encrypt all/some of the channels Spice uses for
its communication. A separate port is used for the encrypted
channels. When connecting through a TLS channel, the Spice client will
verify the certificate sent by the host. It will check that this
certificate matches the hostname it's connecting, and that this
certificate is signed by a known certificate authority (CA). This can
be achieved by either getting the host certificate signed by an
official CA, or by passing to the client the certificate of the
authority which signed the host certificate. The latter allows the use
of self-signed certificates.

Configuration
-------------

.Using virt-manager

IMPORTANT: It's not currently possible to define the CA
certificate/host certificate to use for the TLS connection using
virt-manager, see the next section for how to enable this using
libvirt.

.Using libvirt

The certificate must be specified in libvirtd configuration file in
'/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf' (or in '~/.config/libvirt/qemu.conf' if you
are using a session libvirt). See the documentation in this file
reproduced below:

 # Enable use of TLS encryption on the SPICE server.
 #
 # It is necessary to setup CA and issue a server certificate
 # before enabling this.
 #
 spice_tls = 1


 # Use of TLS requires that x509 certificates be issued. The
 # default it to keep them in /etc/pki/libvirt-spice. This directory
 # must contain
 #
 #  ca-cert.pem - the CA master certificate
 #  server-cert.pem - the server certificate signed with ca-cert.pem
 #  server-key.pem  - the server private key
 #
 # This option allows the certificate directory to be changed.
 #
 spice_tls_x509_cert_dir = "/etc/pki/libvirt-spice"

Once the above is done, when the domain is running, you should get
something like what is below if you are leaving Spice port allocation
up to libvirt:

****
TODO proof-read the following section:
*****

[source,sh]
host$ virsh domdisplay
spice://127.0.0.1?tls-port=5901
host$

This means that the connection is possible both through TLS and
without any encryption. You can edit the libvirt graphics node if you
want to change that behaviour and only allow connections through TLS:

[source,xml]
<graphics type='spice' autoport='yes' defaultMode='secure'/>

.Using QEMU

QEMU expects the certificates to be named the same way as what libvirt
expects in the previous paragraph. The directory where these
certificates can be found is specified as options to the `-spice`
command line parameters:

[source,sh]
-spice port=5900,tls-port=5901,disable-ticketing,x509-dir=/etc/pki/libvirt-spice

Client
------

We need to change 2 things when starting the client:

* specify the tls port to use
* specify the CA certificate to use when verifying the host certificate

With remote-viewer, this is done this way:

[source,sh]
client$ remote-viewer --spice-ca-file=/etc/pki/libvirt-spice/ca-cert.ca spice://myhost?tls-port=5901

Generating self-signed certificates
-----------------------------------

The following script can be used to create the various certificates
needed to use a TLS Spice connection. Make sure to substitute the
hostname of your Spice host in the subject of the certificate signing
request.

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------------------
SERVER_KEY=server-key.pem

# creating a key for our ca
if [ ! -e ca-key.pem ]; then
    openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca-key.pem 1024
fi
# creating a ca
if [ ! -e ca-cert.pem ]; then
    openssl req -new -x509 -days 1095 -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem -utf8 -subj "/C=IL/L=Raanana/O=Red Hat/CN=my CA"
fi
# create server key
if [ ! -e $SERVER_KEY ]; then
    openssl genrsa -out $SERVER_KEY 1024
fi
# create a certificate signing request (csr)
if [ ! -e server-key.csr ]; then
    openssl req -new -key $SERVER_KEY -out server-key.csr -utf8 -subj "/C=IL/L=Raanana/O=Red Hat/CN=myhostname.example.com"
fi
# signing our server certificate with this ca
if [ ! -e server-cert.pem ]; then
    openssl x509 -req -days 1095 -in server-key.csr -CA ca-cert.pem -CAkey ca-key.pem -set_serial 01 -out server-cert.pem
fi

# now create a key that doesn't require a passphrase
openssl rsa -in $SERVER_KEY -out $SERVER_KEY.insecure
mv $SERVER_KEY $SERVER_KEY.secure
mv $SERVER_KEY.insecure $SERVER_KEY

# show the results (no other effect)
openssl rsa -noout -text -in $SERVER_KEY
openssl rsa -noout -text -in ca-key.pem
openssl req -noout -text -in server-key.csr
openssl x509 -noout -text -in server-cert.pem
openssl x509 -noout -text -in ca-cert.pem
-------------------------------------------------

SASL
====

Spice server and client have support for SASL authentication. When
using QEMU, '/etc/sasl2/qemu.conf' will be used as a configuration
file. For testing, you can use the `digest-md5` mechanism, and populate
a test database using `saslpasswd2 -f /etc/qemu/passwd.db -c
foo`. These files have to be readable by the QEMU process that will
handle your VM.

To troubleshoot SASL issues, running `strace -e open` on the QEMU
process can be a useful first step.

Configuration
-------------

.Using virt-manager

It's currently not possible to enable SASL from virt-manager.

.Using libvirt

SASL support for SPICE has been added to libvirt mid-October 2013 so
you need a libvirt version that was released after this date. To
enable SASL, you need to add `spice_sasl = 1` in '/etc/libvirt/qemu.conf'
for the system libvirtd instance, and to '~/.config/libvirt/qemu.conf'
for the session libvirtd instance.

.Using QEMU

Using SASL with QEMU involves a slight modification of the `-spice`
parameter used when running QEMU:

[source,sh]
-spice port=3001,sasl

Client
------

When you start the client as usual, if SASL was enabled on the host,
remote-viewer will pop up a window asking for a password before
starting the Spice session. It won't be established if an incorrect
ticket was passed to the client.

Folder sharing
==============

The Spice client can share a folder with the remote guest. By default,
the client will share the XDG Public Share directory (ie '~/Public' if
you use a regular system).  You may specify a different folder with
`--spice-share-dir` client option.

Configuration
-------------

.Using virt-manager

It's currently not possible to configure folder sharing with virt-manager.

.Using libvirt

In order to set up folder sharing, qemu needs to expose a
`org.spice-space.webdav.0` virtio port, associated with a
corresponding Spice port:

[source,xml]
<devices>
    <channel type='spiceport'>
        <source channel='org.spice-space.webdav.0'/>
        <target type='virtio' name='org.spice-space.webdav.0'/>
    </channel>
</devices>

.Using QEMU

In order to set up folder sharing, qemu needs to expose a
`org.spice-space.webdav.0` virtio port, associated with a
corresponding Spice port:

[source,sh]
-device virtserialport,bus=virtio-serial0.0,nr=1,chardev=charchannel1,id=channel1,name=org.spice-space.webdav.0 -chardev spiceport,name=org.spice-space.webdav.0,id=charchannel1

Guest configuration
-------------------

.Windows
In a Windows guest, you must then install
http://elmarco.fedorapeople.org/spice-webdavd-x86-0.1.24.msi[spice-webdavd]
service, and register the drive (by running 'map-drive.bat' from
'Program Files/Spice webdav').

.Linux

With a Linux guest, you must install the spice-webdavd service (the
sources are available at https://git.gnome.org/browse/phodav). The
folder will show up in GNOME Files network places (or Nautilus). It
can then be mounted and browsed in traditional applications thanks to
`gvfs-fuse`.

 * `set_password spice <password> [keep|disconnect]` Set the spice connection ticket (one time password). An empty password prevents any connection. keep/disconnect indicates what to do if a client is already connected when the command is issued.
 * `expire_password`
 * `client_migrate_info`
 * `info spice` Show current spice state

Spice guest additions
=====================

While you will be able to remotely access your virtual machine through
Spice without making any change to the virtual machine configuration,
you can get better integration if you tweak it specially for Spice.

If your virtual machine has a QXL video device and you install the
corrresponding guest driver, your guest will support higher
resolutions, multiple monitors, resizing to arbitrary resolutions, ...

Installing the Spice vdagent in your guest will let you copy and paste
between your guest and client OSes, to drag and drop files between the
2 OSes, ... In order for the agent to work, your virtual machine must
have a virtio serial device (and the corresponding guest drivers) as
well as a Spice spicevmc channel.

Windows guest
-------------

The recommended way of getting all the needed drivers installed is to
use the all-in-one Spice guest tools installer which can be found on
http://spice-space.org/download/windows/spice-guest-tools/[spice-space.org].

To get USB redirection working on Windows, you need to install USB
Clerk (TODO: add link)

If you want to manually install them, the QXL driver can be downloaded
from http://spice-space.org/download/windows/qxl/[this location] ,
agent builds can be found
http://spice-space.org/download/windows/vdagent/[here]. You also need
the vioserial driver which is distributed with the other
https://alt.fedoraproject.org/pub/alt/virtio-win/latest/images/bin/[
virtio-win drivers].

Installation
============

Installing Spice on RHEL or Fedora
----------------------------------

Be aware that RHEL has no builds of qemu/spice-server for i386, only
x86_64 builds are available.  RHEL >=6 and Fedora >=13

[source,sh]
yum install qemu-kvm virt-viewer

The package spice-protocol will be downloaded automatically as a
dependency of package kvm.

RHEVM Users
~~~~~~~~~~~

oVirt/RHEVM users could be also interested in the spice-xpi package as
it allows you to execute spice-client directly from the oVirt/RHEVM
UserPortal.

[source,sh]
yum install spice-xpi

General build instructions
--------------------------

This section is for distributions that don't have Spice packages in
their repositories. It will show you step by step how to build the
required Spice components.

Client requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the http://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice-gtk/tree/README[README
file in spice-gtk] for the list of dependencies.

Host requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 * KVM supported by kernel (It should work also without KVM, but it's
   not being tested as most Linux distrubitions already support KVM.)


Guest requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Linux guest

spice-vdagent requires virtio-serial support to be enabled. This is
described in the chapter <<agent>>. Guest should have installed qxl
driver (xorg-x11-drv-qxl on Fedora and RHEL).

.Windows guest

Drivers for QXL and drivers for virtio-serial require Win XP SP3.

Building
~~~~~~~~

The environment variable `$BUILD_ROOT` will point to a directory with
stored sources and will be used during the whole build process. The
variable `$INST_ROOT` will point to a directory in which Spice will be
installed.

IMPORTANT: These instructions may be outdated. Feel free to ask on the
Spice mailing list if you need help building from source.

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------------------
export BUILD_ROOT=/tmp/spice; mkdir $BUILD_ROOT
export INST_ROOT="/opt/spice"; mkdir $INST_ROOT
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$INST_ROOT/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH

cd $BUILD_ROOT
git clone git://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/spice
cd $BUILD_ROOT/spice
./configure --prefix=$INST_ROOT
make
make install

cd $BUILD_ROOT
git clone git://git.qemu.org/qemu.git
cd $BUILD_ROOT/qemu
./configure --prefix=$INST_ROOT --target-list=x86_64-softmmu --enable-spice
make
make install
-------------------------------------------------

Setting up PATH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last steps before starting with Spice are to set proper `PATH`
variable. For example RHEL is using /usr/libexec as directory for
qemu-kvm binaries. The following setup should be suitable for qemu and
Spice built according to the instructions in this chapter.

[source,sh]
-------------------------------------------------
echo "export PATH=$PATH:$INST_ROOT/bin" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
-------------------------------------------------

You should now be able to access the qemu-system-x86_64 Spice binary.
